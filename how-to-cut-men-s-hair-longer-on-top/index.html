This will help ensure that you get the best results possible.</p><p>First, make sure your client's hair is clean and dry. If it's wet, it will be harder to see the length and texture of the hair, which could lead to mistakes.</p><p>Next, comb through the hair to remove any tangles or knots. This will make it easier to cut and ensure that the final result is even.</p><p>Finally, consider using a styling product to help hold the hair in place. This can be especially helpful if your client has thick or unruly hair. A small amount of gel or wax can help keep the hair in place while you work.</p><h2 id="section2">Section 2: How to Cut Men's Hair Longer on Top</h2><p>Now it's time to start cutting! Follow these steps to achieve a longer style on top:</p><ol><li>Start by sectioning off the top of the hair. Use a comb to separate the hair at the crown of the head.</li><li>Using scissors, trim the hair along the top section to the desired length. It's best to start with small cuts and work your way up to the final length.</li><li>Next, blend the sides and back of the hair into the longer top section. Use scissors or clippers to create a gradual fade from the longer hair on top to the shorter hair on the sides and back.</li><li>Finally, use thinning shears to add texture to the longer hair on top. This will help create a natural, tousled look.</li></ol><p>Remember to take your time and check your work frequently. It's better to make small adjustments as you go than to have to start over from scratch.</p><h2 id="section3">Section 3: Tips for Cutting Men's Hair Longer on Top</h2><p>Here are a few tips to help you achieve the best results when cutting men's hair longer on top:</p><ul><li>Start with a shorter length and work your way up.
