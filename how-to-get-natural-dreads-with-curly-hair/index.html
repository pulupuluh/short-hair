If you want to achieve natural-looking dreads, then you need to avoid using any chemicals or products that can damage your hair. Here are the steps you need to follow to get natural dreads with curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Before starting the process of getting natural dreads with curly hair, make sure your hair is clean. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup or excess oil from your hair. This will help your hair knot and tangle more easily.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small, equal parts. Use a comb to create sections that are the same size. This will help you achieve even and uniform dreads. Use hair clips to keep each section separated.</p><h3>Step 3: Twist and Knot Hair</h3><p>Take one section of hair and twist it tightly. Use your fingers to knot the twisted hair together. Continue to twist and knot the hair until it starts to form a dread. Repeat this process with each section of hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Maintain Your Dreads</h3><p>Once you have achieved the desired number of dreads, you need to maintain them. This involves washing them regularly with a residue-free shampoo, and separating any knots or tangles that may form. You can also use a natural oil or locking gel to help your dreads stay in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Natural Dreads with Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you maintain your natural dreads with curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a residue-free shampoo to wash your dreads.
