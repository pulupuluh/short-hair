It's also a good idea to have a mirror set up so you can see the back of the head.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying the hair. This will make it easier to cut and ensure that the hair is clean and free of any product build-up.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb the Hair</h3><p>Using a comb, separate the hair into sections.
