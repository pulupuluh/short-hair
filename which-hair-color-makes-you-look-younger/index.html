Generally, warm hair colors like golden blonde, honey blonde, and caramel brown flatter most skin tones and make people look younger.

If you have cool undertones, choose ashy or cool shades.</li><li>Think about your natural hair color. If you have dark hair, it's best to stick to shades that are no more than two shades lighter or darker than your natural color. If you have light hair, you can experiment with more dramatic colors.</li><li>Look at your eye color. Certain shades, like copper and auburn, can bring out the color in your eyes.</li><li>Consult with a professional stylist.
