You want a brush that can add volume and texture to your hair without causing damage or breakage. The best round brushes for short fine hair are typically small in size, have a ceramic or tourmaline coating, and have densely packed bristles.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>Before using a round brush for blow drying, make sure your hair is clean and towel-dried.
