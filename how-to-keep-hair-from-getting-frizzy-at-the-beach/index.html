Tie Your Hair Up</h3><p>If you're going to be in the water, tie your hair up in a bun or ponytail. This will help to prevent tangles and keep your hair from getting wet and frizzy.</p><h3>4. Wear a Hat</h3><p>Wearing a hat is a great way to protect your hair from the sun and wind. It will also help to keep your hair from getting tangled and frizzy.</p><h3>5.
