Tie Your Hair Up</h3><p>If you're going to be in the water, tie your hair up in a bun or ponytail. This will help to prevent tangles and keep your hair from getting wet and frizzy.</p><h3>4. Wear a Hat</h3><p>Wearing a hat is a great way to protect your hair from the sun and wind. It will also help to keep your hair from getting tangled and frizzy.</p><h3>5. Rinse Your Hair with Fresh Water</h3><p>After you get out of the water, rinse your hair with fresh water. This will help to remove any salt or sand that may be in your hair. It will also help to prevent your hair from becoming dry and frizzy.</p><h3>6. Apply a Hair Oil or Serum</h3><p>After you rinse your hair, apply a hair oil or serum to your hair.
