No matter how much you try to tame it, it always seems to have a mind of its own. But fear not, there are ways to get hair to be less poofy and achieve a sleeker, smoother look. In this article, we'll go over some tips and tricks on how to get hair to be less poofy.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Poofy hair can be caused by a variety of factors such as humidity, dryness, and genetics. It can make your hair look frizzy, voluminous, and hard to manage. However, there are ways to tame your poofy hair and achieve a sleeker, more manageable look. By following a few simple steps, you can get your hair to be less poofy and more manageable.</p><h2>How to</h2><h3>1. Use the right shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>One of the most important things you can do to get hair to be less poofy is to use the right shampoo and conditioner. Look for products that are designed to tame frizz and provide moisture to your hair. Avoid products that contain sulfates, as they can strip your hair of its natural oils and make it more prone to frizz.</p><h3>2. Don't over-wash your hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, leaving it dry and prone to frizz. Try to limit your hair washing to once or twice a week, and use a dry shampoo in between washes to keep your hair looking fresh.</p><h3>3. Use a deep conditioning treatment</h3><p>Deep conditioning treatments can help to restore moisture to your hair and tame frizz. Look for products that contain ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, or shea butter. Apply the treatment to your hair once a week and leave it on for at least 30 minutes before rinsing it out.</p><h3>4. Use a heat protectant</h3><p>If you use heat styling tools like a flat iron or curling wand, make sure to use a heat protectant spray or serum. This will help to protect your hair from damage and prevent it from becoming poofy and frizzy.</p><h3>5. Don't brush your hair when it's wet</h3><p>Wet hair is more prone to breakage, so it's important to be gentle when you're brushing it. Use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to gently remove any knots or tangles. Avoid using a regular brush, as this can cause your hair to become more poofy and frizzy.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair with a frizz-taming shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that are designed to tame frizz and provide moisture.
