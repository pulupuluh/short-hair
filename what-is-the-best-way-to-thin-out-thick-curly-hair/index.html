These products work by coating the hair shaft and separating the curls, making them look more defined and less bulky.</p><h3>Getting a Chemical Treatment</h3><p>Chemical treatments, such as a relaxer or a keratin treatment, can be used to permanently or temporarily straighten thick curly hair, making it easier to manage and style.
