The genes responsible for hair texture can differ from one section of your head to another. For example, the genes that control curly hair might be more dominant in the front of your head, while the genes that control wavy hair might be more dominant in the back.</p><p>This can be seen in many people who have curly hair in the front and wavy hair in the back. It's important to note that genetics is not something you can change, so if this is the reason why your hair looks the way it does, you'll just have to embrace it!</p><h2 id="styling">Styling</h2><p>Another reason why the front of your hair might be curly and the back is wavy could be due to styling. If you tend to style your hair in a certain way, such as wearing it in a ponytail or bun, this can cause the hair in the back to be pulled straighter than the hair in the front. This can result in a wavy texture in the back and a curly texture in the front.</p><p>To avoid this, try to switch up your hairstyles and avoid putting too much tension on your hair in one area.

If you're using different products on different sections of your hair, this can cause your hair to have different textures. For example, if you're using a heavy conditioner on the back of your hair but a lighter one on the front, this can cause the back to be wavy while the front is curly.</p><p>To avoid this, try to use the same products on all sections of your hair.
