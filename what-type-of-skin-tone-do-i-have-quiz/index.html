There are three main categories: cool, warm, and neutral.</p><p>Cool skin tones have pink or blue undertones, while warm skin tones have yellow or golden undertones. Neutral skin tones are a mix of both warm and cool undertones.</p><p>To determine your skin tone, start by looking at your veins. If your veins appear blue or purple, you likely have cool undertones.

Are they blue or purple? If yes, you likely have cool undertones. If they appear green, you probably have warm undertones. If you can't tell, you may have a neutral undertone.</li><li>Next, examine your skin in natural light. Does it have a pink or blue tint? If so, you probably have cool undertones. If your skin has a yellow or golden tint, you likely have warm undertones. If you can't tell, you may have a neutral undertone.</li><li>Finally, consider how your skin reacts to the sun.
