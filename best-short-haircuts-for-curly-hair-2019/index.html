For example, a bob may look great on someone with an oval face, but may not be as flattering on someone with a round face.</li><li>Curl type: Different curl types may require different haircuts. For example, someone with tight curls may benefit from a shorter haircut that allows their curls to bounce and spring, while someone with looser curls may prefer a longer, layered cut.</li><li>Personal style: Ultimately, the best short haircut for your curly hair is one that makes you feel confident and beautiful. Consider your personal style and what will make you feel most comfortable.</li></ul><p>With these factors in mind, here are some of the best short haircuts for curly hair in 2019:</p><h3>The Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut is a classic short haircut that can look great on curly hair. This cut is typically short on the sides and back, with longer layers on top that can be styled in a variety of ways. The pixie cut is a great option for someone with tight curls, as it allows their curls to bounce freely.</p><h3>The Bob</h3><p>The bob is another classic short haircut that can look great on curly hair. This cut is typically chin-length and can be styled in a variety of ways, from sleek and straight to curly and voluminous. The bob is a great option for someone with looser curls or wavy hair.</p><h3>The Shag</h3><p>The shag is a layered haircut that can look great on curly hair. This cut is typically shoulder-length or shorter and features lots of layers throughout. The shag is a great option for someone with medium to long curls, as it allows their curls to have movement and texture.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Short Curly Hair</h2><p>Styling short curly hair can be a challenge, but with the right techniques and products, it’s possible to create a variety of looks. Here’s a step-by-step guide to styling short curly hair:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, damp hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for curly hair.</li><li>Apply a curl-defining cream or gel to your hair, starting at the roots and working your way down to the ends.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. This will help to enhance your curls and prevent frizz.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron or wand to define any curls that need a little extra help.</li><li>Finish with a light-hold hairspray to keep your curls in place.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Short Curly Hair</h2><p>Maintaining short curly hair requires some extra care and attention. Here are some tips to keep your curls looking their best:</p><ul><li>Avoid washing your hair every day. Curly hair tends to be dry, and washing it too often can strip it of its natural oils.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to help keep your curls moisturized.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it’s dry. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your curls.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often. Heat can damage your curls and make them look limp and lifeless.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Short Haircuts for Curly Hair</h2><h3>Q: Will a short haircut make my curly hair look frizzy?</h3><p>A: Not necessarily. With the right styling products and techniques, it’s possible to create a frizz-free look with short curly hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I still wear my hair up with a short curly haircut?</h3><p>A: Yes! There are plenty of ways to style short curly hair, including updos and half-up styles.</p><h3>Q: Will a short haircut make my curls look less defined?</h3><p>A: It depends on the haircut and your natural curl pattern. Some short haircuts can actually enhance your curls and make them look more defined.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Short Curly Hair</h2><p>When it comes to caring for short curly hair, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for curly hair.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as they can damage your curls.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to help keep your curls moisturized.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it’s dry.
