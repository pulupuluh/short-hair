Women at 60 should focus on taking care of their skin, using moisturizers and sunscreens to protect against the sun's harmful rays. </p><p> Women should also consider using makeup to enhance their natural beauty, rather than trying to cover up their age. A little bit of concealer, blush, and lipstick can go a long way in making a woman look and feel beautiful at 60. </p><h3> Tips for Beauty at 60 </h3><ul><li> Use moisturizers and sunscreens to protect against the sun </li><li> Use makeup to enhance natural beauty </li><li> Experiment with new hairstyles and makeup looks </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><p> Q: Should a woman at 60 wear makeup? </p><p> A: Yes, women at 60 can wear makeup to enhance their natural beauty.
