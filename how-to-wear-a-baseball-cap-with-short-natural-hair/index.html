Make sure to select a cap that fits your head comfortably and has a deeper crown to accommodate your hair. Avoid caps with shallow crowns, as they won’t provide enough room for your hair and can cause discomfort.</p><h3>Step 2: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Before putting on your cap, you’ll want to style your hair in a way that will complement the cap. If you have a TWA (teeny weeny afro), you can leave it as is or add a small amount of product to define your curls. If your hair is longer, you can opt for a wash-and-go or a twist-out. Whatever style you choose, make sure it won’t create bulk under your cap.</p><h3>Step 3: Wear Your Cap</h3><p>Now it’s time to put on your cap! Start by tilting the cap forward slightly and placing it on the back of your head. Pull the cap down until it sits comfortably on your head, making sure not to flatten your hair. You can adjust the cap to sit higher or lower on your head depending on your preference.</p><h3>Step 4: Style the Brim</h3><p>The final step is to style the brim of your cap. You can wear the brim straight forward, tilted to the side, or even slightly curved. Experiment with different angles to find the one that suits you best.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Wearing a Baseball Cap with Short Natural Hair:</h2><ul><li>Choose a cap with a deeper crown to accommodate your hair.</li><li>Avoid caps with shallow crowns, as they won’t provide enough room for your hair and can cause discomfort.</li><li>Style your hair in a way that won’t create bulk under your cap.</li><li>Experiment with different brim angles to find the one that suits you best.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ:</h2><h3>Can I wear a baseball cap with a TWA?</h3><p>Yes!
