They are created by allowing the hair to mat and tangle together into long, rope-like strands. While many people think that dreads are only for those with naturally kinky or coily hair, anyone can get them, including those with relaxed hair.</p><p>If you're interested in getting long dreads with relaxed hair, you may be wondering how long it will take. The truth is, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The time it takes to get long dreads depends on a variety of factors, including your hair type, the thickness of your hair, and how fast your hair grows.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>Before you start the process of getting dreads, it's important to know that it takes time and patience. Here's a general overview of the steps involved in getting long dreads:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean hair</h3><p>Wash your hair thoroughly with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or product residue. Make sure to rinse your hair well and towel dry it.</p><h3>Step 2: Section your hair</h3><p>Using a comb, section your hair into small, equal-sized squares. This will help your dreads form evenly.</p><h3>Step 3: Backcomb your hair</h3><p>Starting at the roots, use a small comb to backcomb each section of hair. This involves combing the hair backwards towards the scalp, which creates tangles and knots that will eventually lead to dreadlocks.</p><h3>Step 4: Roll and twist your hair</h3><p>Once you've backcombed your hair, roll and twist each section tightly. This will help to further tangle the hair and create the beginnings of your dreads. You can also use a crochet hook to help tighten and shape your dreads.</p><h3>Step 5: Maintain your dreads</h3><p>Once your dreads have formed, you'll need to maintain them regularly to keep them looking neat and tidy. This involves palm rolling and separating your dreads to prevent them from merging together.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide to getting long dreads:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo. This will remove any product buildup or residue that may be in your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Section your hair</h3><p>Using a comb, section your hair into small, equal-sized squares. Make sure to part your hair in a way that will allow your dreads to fall in a natural-looking pattern.</p><h3>Step 3: Backcomb your hair</h3><p>Starting at the roots, use a small comb to backcomb each section of hair. Work your way down to the ends of your hair, making sure to create tight knots and tangles. The more backcombing you do, the faster your dreads will form.</p><h3>Step 4: Roll and twist your hair</h3><p>Once you've backcombed your hair, roll and twist each section tightly. This will help to further tangle the hair and create the beginnings of your dreads. You can also use a crochet hook to help tighten and shape your dreads.</p><h3>Step 5: Maintain your dreads</h3><p>After your dreads have formed, you'll need to maintain them regularly to keep them looking neat and tidy.
