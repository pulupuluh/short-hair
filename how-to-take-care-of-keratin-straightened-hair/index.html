This treatment involves applying a keratin-based formula to your hair and then using heat to seal it in. However, after the treatment, it's important to take care of your hair properly to maintain its health and prevent damage.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>Here are some tips on how to take care of your keratin straightened hair:</p><h3>1. Avoid washing your hair too often</h3><p>When you have keratin straightened hair, it's important to avoid washing it too often. Washing your hair too frequently can strip away the keratin and make your hair dry and brittle. Instead, try to wash your hair no more than two or three times a week.</p><h3>2. Use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>When you do wash your hair, make sure to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfates can be harsh on your hair and can strip away the keratin. Look for products that are specifically designed for keratin-treated hair.</p><h3>3. Avoid using heat styling tools</h3><p>If possible, try to avoid using heat styling tools like blow dryers, straighteners, and curling irons. Heat can damage your hair and can cause the keratin to break down more quickly. If you do need to use heat styling tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray and to use the lowest heat setting possible.</p><h3>4. Protect your hair from the sun</h3><p>The sun's UV rays can also damage your hair and cause the keratin to break down. If you're going to be spending time outside, make sure to wear a hat or use a hair product that contains UV protection.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><h3>1. Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Make sure to massage the shampoo into your scalp and rinse thoroughly. Apply the conditioner to the ends of your hair and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing.</p><h3>2. Pat your hair dry with a towel</h3><p>After washing your hair, gently pat it dry with a towel. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously, as this can cause damage and breakage.</p><h3>3. Apply a keratin-based leave-in conditioner</h3><p>Apply a keratin-based leave-in conditioner to your hair to help maintain the keratin and keep your hair hydrated. Make sure to apply the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends.</p><h3>4. Let your hair air dry</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools if possible. Instead, let your hair air dry naturally. If you need to speed up the drying process, use a hair dryer on the cool setting.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair instead of a brush, which can cause breakage.</li><li>Avoid tying your hair back tightly, as this can cause breakage and damage to the keratin.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Avoid using hair products that contain alcohol, as this can dry out your hair.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: How long does keratin straightening last?</h3><p>A: Keratin straightening can last anywhere from three to six months, depending on how well you take care of your hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I color my hair after getting keratin straightening?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can color your hair after getting keratin straightening. However, it's best to wait at least two weeks after the treatment to give your hair time to recover.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Taking care of keratin straightened hair requires some extra attention and care, but it's worth it to maintain the health and beauty of your hair. By following these tips and taking good care of your hair, you can enjoy the benefits of keratin straightening for months to come.</p></article>
