They are also great for those who want to achieve defined and bouncy curls. Here's how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>The first step is to wash and condition your hair. Make sure to use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type. Rinse your hair thoroughly and towel dry it.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner or a heat protectant to your hair. This will protect your hair from damage and make it easier to curl.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small sections. The size of the section will depend on the size of the sponge rod you're using. The smaller the rod, the smaller the section should be.</p><h3>Step 4: Roll the Sponge Rods</h3><p>Take a section of hair and wrap it around the sponge rod. Roll the rod up towards your scalp and secure it in place with the clips provided. Repeat this process until all of your hair is in sponge rods.</p><h3>Step 5: Allow Hair to Dry</h3><p>Allow your hair to dry completely before removing the sponge rods. You can either air dry your hair or use a hair dryer on low heat to speed up the process.</p><h3>Step 6: Remove the Sponge Rods</h3><p>Once your hair is completely dry, remove the sponge rods. Gently unravel each rod and let your curls fall naturally. Do not brush or comb your curls.</p><h3>Step 7: Style Your Curls</h3><p>Style your curls with your fingers.
