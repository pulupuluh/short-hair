However, if the hat or helmet is too tight or rubs against your scalp, it could cause hair breakage or damage.</p><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can cause temporary hair loss, a condition called telogen effluvium. This type of hair loss usually resolves on its own once the stressor is removed.</p><h3>Q: Are there any medications that can cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, certain medications can cause hair loss as a side effect. These include chemotherapy drugs, blood thinners, and some antidepressants.</p><h3>Q: Is hair loss always permanent?</h3><p>A: No, not all hair loss is permanent. Some types of hair loss, such as telogen effluvium, are temporary and will grow back on their own.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you’re concerned about hair loss, remember that you’re not alone.
