An oblong face shape is characterized by a long and narrow face with a prominent chin, high forehead, and angular jawline. This face shape is considered to be one of the most attractive and versatile shapes, allowing for a wide range of hairstyles and makeup looks. In this article, we will discuss how to get oblong face shape, including tips, step-by-step instructions, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Description of Oblong Face Shape</h2><p>The oblong face shape is also known as rectangular or elongated face shape. It is longer than it is wide and has a prominent chin, high forehead, and angular jawline. The cheeks are usually flat, and the face has a straight and narrow appearance. This face shape is considered to be one of the most versatile shapes, allowing for a wide range of hairstyles and makeup looks.</p><h2>How to Get Oblong Face Shape</h2><p>To get oblong face shape, you need to follow a few simple steps. These include:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step in getting oblong face shape is to determine your face shape. You can do this by measuring your face with a measuring tape or ruler. Measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline, as well as the length of your face from the hairline to the chin. If the length of your face is more than the width, you have an oblong face shape.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Hairstyle</h3><p>The right hairstyle can make a big difference in how your face looks. For oblong face shape, hairstyles that add volume and width to the sides of your face are ideal. This includes layered hairstyles, wavy or curly hair, and side-swept bangs. Avoid hairstyles that are too long and straight or that pull your hair back tightly, as these can make your face appear even longer.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Makeup to Enhance Your Features</h3><p>Makeup can also be used to enhance your features and create the illusion of a more balanced face shape. For oblong face shape, focus on adding volume to your cheeks with blush and contouring your jawline to create a more defined shape. Avoid using too much highlighter on your forehead, as this can make your face appear even longer.</p><h3>Step 4: Wear the Right Accessories</h3><p>Accessories can also help balance out your face shape. For oblong face shape, choose accessories that add width to your face, such as wide-brimmed hats, statement earrings, and round or square-shaped sunglasses. Avoid accessories that are too long or narrow, as these can make your face appear even longer.</p><h2>Tips for Getting Oblong Face Shape</h2><p>In addition to the above steps, here are some tips for getting oblong face shape:</p><ul><li>Choose hairstyles and makeup looks that suit your individual features and personality.</li><li>Experiment with different styles and looks until you find what works best for you.</li><li>Take care of your hair and skin to keep them looking healthy and radiant.</li><li>Be confident and embrace your unique features.</li></ul><h2>FAQ About Oblong Face Shape</h2><h3>What are the best hairstyles for oblong face shape?</h3><p>The best hairstyles for oblong face shape include layered hairstyles, wavy or curly hair, and side-swept bangs.
