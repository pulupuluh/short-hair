This classic cut is popular for its clean and sharp look, and it's relatively easy to achieve at home. In this article, we'll go through the steps to help you learn how to cut your own hair short back and sides.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The short back and sides haircut is characterized by having shorter hair on the sides and back of the head, with longer hair on top. This style is popular among men and can be achieved with clippers or scissors.</p><h2>How To: Cut Your Own Hair Short Back and Sides</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before starting, make sure you have the necessary tools. You'll need a pair of clippers, scissors, a comb, and a mirror. It's also a good idea to have a spray bottle with water to dampen your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and allowing it to dry naturally. You want your hair to be dry but not too fluffy. Dampen your hair with the spray bottle, starting from the back of your head and working your way forward.</p><h3>Step 3: Start with the Sides</h3><p>Using your clippers, attach a guard that's appropriate for the length you want to achieve. Start at the bottom of the side of your head and work your way up, moving the clippers in an upward motion. Repeat on the other side.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Sides and Back</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting the sides, move on to the back of your head. Use a longer guard than you used on the sides and start from the bottom, working your way up. Use the shorter guard to blend the sides and back together.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Top</h3><p>Using your scissors, cut the hair on top of your head to the desired length. Start by cutting the back and work your way to the front, cutting small sections at a time. Use your comb to lift the hair and cut it evenly.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for Evenness</h3><p>It's important to check for evenness throughout the process. Use your mirror to check the sides and back of your head. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the cut is even.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Start with a longer guard when cutting the sides and back, you can always go shorter later.</li><li>Use your fingers to lift the hair and cut it to the desired length.</li><li>Take your time and be patient, it's better to make small adjustments than to cut too much at once.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I use scissors to cut the sides?</h3><p>Yes, you can use scissors to cut the sides, but it's easier to use clippers for a more even cut.</p><h3>Do I need to wet my hair before cutting it?</h3><p>It's best to dampen your hair with a spray bottle before cutting it. This helps to control the hair and make it easier to cut.</p><h3>Can I cut my hair if it's curly?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your hair if it's curly, but it may be more difficult to achieve an even cut. It's best to seek professional help if you're unsure.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After cutting your hair, it's important to take care of it properly. Use a shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type and avoid over-styling with heat tools. Regular trims will help to keep your hair looking neat and healthy.</p><p>Now that you know how to cut your own hair short back and sides, you can save money on trips to the barber and achieve a clean and stylish look from the comfort of your own home.</p></article>
