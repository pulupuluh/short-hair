Unfortunately, sometimes the damage is more than just split ends and breakage – your hair may actually start falling out. This can be a scary and frustrating experience, especially if you love your blonde locks. But don't worry, there are steps you can take to stop the hair loss and help your hair recover.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Bleach is a powerful chemical that can strip your hair of its natural oils and proteins. This can cause your hair to become dry, brittle, and prone to breakage. In some cases, the damage can be so severe that your hair starts falling out. This can be a result of over-processing, leaving the bleach on for too long, or using a bleach that is too strong for your hair type.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're experiencing hair loss from bleach, there are a few things you can do to help your hair recover:</p><h3>1. Stop Bleaching Your Hair</h3><p>The first step is to stop bleaching your hair altogether. Give your hair a break and let it recover. This means avoiding any further chemical treatments, including perms and relaxers.</p><h3>2. Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>Protein treatments can help to strengthen your hair and prevent further breakage. Look for a treatment that contains keratin, which is a protein that is naturally found in hair. Apply the treatment once a week for best results.</p><h3>3. Moisturize Your Hair</h3><p>Dry hair is more prone to breakage, so it's important to keep your hair moisturized. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to help replenish your hair's natural oils. You can also use a leave-in conditioner to help keep your hair hydrated throughout the day.</p><h3>4. Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>Avoid brushing or combing your hair when it's wet, as this can cause further breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to gently detangle your hair. Be careful when styling your hair, and avoid using heat tools as much as possible.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on what to do if your hair is falling out from bleach:</p><h3>Step 1: Stop Bleaching Your Hair</h3><p>The first step is to stop bleaching your hair altogether.
