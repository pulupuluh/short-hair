You don't want them to die or get stuck in the middle of a cut!</p><h2 id="prepare">How to prepare for the haircut</h2><p>Start by washing and drying the hair. This will make it easier to cut and remove any dirt or product buildup. Then, comb the hair in the direction it naturally falls. If the hair is longer than an inch, consider tying or clipping it into sections to make the process easier.</p><p>Put a cape or towel around the person's neck to catch any hair clippings. If you're cutting your own hair, wear a shirt you don't mind getting hair on or use a towel to cover your shoulders.</p><h2 id="section">How to section the hair</h2><p>Sectioning the hair will help you cut it evenly and avoid missing any spots. Start by dividing the hair into four sections: top, sides, back, and nape. Use clips or hair ties to keep each section separate.</p><p>Start with the top section and clip the rest out of the way. Comb the hair straight up and use the clippers to cut it to the desired length. Start with a longer guard and work your way down until you get the length you want. Use a shorter guard around the edges to blend the hair.</p><h2 id="cut">How to cut the hair with clippers</h2><p>When using clippers, hold them with the blade facing downwards and move them against the direction of hair growth. Start at the nape and work your way up to the crown, cutting against the grain. Use a consistent motion and keep the clippers parallel to the head. Use a comb to guide the clippers and ensure an even cut.</p><p>When cutting the sides and back, use the same technique but be careful around the ears and neckline. Use a smaller guard or no guard at all to create a fade or taper. Blend the hair by going over the edges with a longer guard.</p><h2 id="blend">How to blend the hair</h2><p>Blending is the process of making the hair look seamless and natural, without any harsh lines or transitions. Use scissors to blend the top section with the sides and back. Comb the hair and vertically cut into it, using the tips of the scissors. This will create texture and remove any bulk. Use your fingers to pull the hair outwards and check for any uneven spots.</p><h2 id="clean">How to clean up the haircut</h2><p>After the cut, use a brush or vacuum to remove any hair clippings from the person's neck and shoulders. Use a damp towel to wipe away any stray hairs. If you're cutting your own hair, take a shower or use a hand-held vacuum to clean up.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for a successful haircut</h2><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down. You can always go shorter, but you can't go back!</li><li>Use a comb to guide the clippers and ensure an even cut.</li><li>Check the hair from different angles to avoid missing any spots.</li><li>Take breaks if needed. Cutting hair can be tiring and stressful.</li><li>Practice makes perfect. Don't worry if your first few haircuts aren't perfect. Keep trying and you'll get better.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can I use clippers to cut wet hair?</h3><p>It's best to cut dry hair with clippers, as wet hair can clog the blades and make the process more difficult. However, if you must cut wet hair, make sure to oil the blades beforehand and use a higher guard to avoid cutting too much off.</p><h3>How often should I oil my clippers?</h3><p>You should oil your clippers before each use to ensure they run smoothly and don't get stuck. Apply a few drops of clipper oil to the blades and turn them on for a few seconds to distribute the oil.</p><h3>Can I cut my own hair with clippers?</h3><p>Yes, you can! Just make sure to use a mirror and take your time. It may be helpful to have someone else check the back of your head for any uneven spots.</p><h2 id="care">Hair care after the cut</h2><p>After the cut, rinse the hair with water and shampoo to remove any stray hairs or product buildup. Use a conditioner to soften the hair and make it easier to style. Avoid using too much heat or product on the hair, as this can damage it over time.</p><p>Now that you know how to cut men's hair with clippers yourself, you can save time and money by doing it at home. With a little practice and patience, you can give yourself or your loved ones a great haircut without leaving the house. Happy clipping!</p></article>
