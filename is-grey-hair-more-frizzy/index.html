This can make it more difficult for hair to retain moisture and resist frizz.</p><p>Another reason that grey hair can be more frizzy is that it is often coarser than other hair types. Coarse hair has a thicker cuticle layer, which can make it more difficult to manage and style.

First, make sure you are using the right hair care products. Look for products that are specifically designed for dry or damaged hair. These products will help to nourish and hydrate your hair, which can reduce frizz.</p><p>Another important step in managing frizzy grey hair is to avoid heat styling. Heat styling tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, can damage hair and make it more prone to frizz. Instead, try air-drying your hair or using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer.</p><p>Finally, consider getting a regular trim. Trimming your hair every six to eight weeks can help to remove split ends and keep your hair healthy.
