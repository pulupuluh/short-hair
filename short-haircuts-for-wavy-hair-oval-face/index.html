If you have an oval face shape and wavy hair, you're in luck! There are plenty of short haircuts that can flatter your face shape and enhance your natural texture. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know about short haircuts for wavy hair oval face, including how to choose the right cut and style, tips for maintenance, and more. Let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Content:</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Choose the Right Cut and Style</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting and Styling Short Hair</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Maintaining Short Haircuts for Wavy Hair Oval Face</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ About Short Haircuts for Wavy Hair Oval Face</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Wavy Hair</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Right Cut and Style</h2><p>The first step in choosing the right short haircut for wavy hair oval face is determining your face shape. An oval face shape is longer than it is wide and has a slightly rounded jawline. If you have an oval face shape, you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to hairstyles. Many short haircuts work well with this face shape, including bobs, pixies, and shags.</p><p>When choosing a haircut, it's important to consider your hair texture. Wavy hair can be thick or thin, so you'll need to choose a haircut that works with your natural volume. If you have thick, wavy hair, a layered bob or shag can help to thin out your hair and create a more manageable style. If your hair is thinner, a pixie cut or blunt bob can help to add volume and texture.</p><p>Once you've chosen a cut, it's time to think about styling. Wavy hair looks best when it's allowed to air dry, so you may want to consider a wash-and-go hairstyle. If you prefer to style your hair, consider using a curling iron or a texturizing spray to enhance your natural waves.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting and Styling Short Hair</h2><p>If you're ready to take the plunge and cut your hair short, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.
