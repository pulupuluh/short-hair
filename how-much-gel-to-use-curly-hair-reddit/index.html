So, how much gel is the right amount for curly hair?</p><p>According to Reddit users, the amount of gel you should use depends on the length and thickness of your hair.

Make sure to distribute the gel evenly throughout your hair.</li><li>Flip your head back up and use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair.
