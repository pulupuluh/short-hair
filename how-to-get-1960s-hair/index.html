From the mod looks of London to the bohemian styles of San Francisco, the 1960s were a decade of experimentation and change. One of the most iconic looks of the era was the hair. From voluminous bouffants to sleek, straight styles, 1960s hair was all about making a statement. In this guide, we'll show you how to get 1960s hair for a retro look that's perfect for any occasion.</p><h2>Description: What is 1960s hair?</h2><p>1960s hair was characterized by a number of different styles. One of the most popular was the bouffant, which was a high, voluminous style that was often worn with a headband or scarf. Another popular style was the beehive, which was similar to the bouffant but with more height at the crown. Straight, sleek styles were also popular, as were curly looks that were achieved with rollers or a curling iron.</p><h2>How to Get 1960s Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Start with the Right Cut</h3><p>The first step to getting 1960s hair is to start with the right cut. Look for a style that has plenty of volume and movement, such as a layered cut or a shaggy bob. You may also want to consider getting bangs, as they were a popular feature of many 1960s hairstyles.</p><h3>Step 2: Get the Right Products</h3><p>To achieve the perfect 1960s hair look, you'll need the right products. Look for volumizing shampoos and conditioners, as well as styling products like mousse, hairspray, and pomade. You may also need a straightening iron or curling iron, depending on the style you're going for.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've washed and conditioned your hair, it's time to blow dry it. Use a round brush to add volume and curl to your hair, working in small sections from the roots to the ends. If you're going for a straight style, use a flat brush instead.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Depending on the style you're going for, you may need to use a curling iron or straightening iron to achieve the right look. For a bouffant or beehive, use a teasing comb to add volume at the crown, then smooth the top layer over with a brush. For a straight style, use a flat iron to smooth your hair from the roots to the ends.</p><h3>Tips for Getting 1960s Hair</h3><p>Here are some tips for getting the perfect 1960s hair:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing product like mousse or hairspray to add height and body to your hair.</li><li>For a sleek, straight style, use a flat iron to smooth your hair from the roots to the ends.</li><li>For a curly style, use a curling iron or rollers to create soft, bouncy curls.</li><li>Accessorize your hair with headbands, scarves, or barrettes for a retro look.</li><li>Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and products until you find the perfect look for you.</li></ul><h3>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p>Q: Can I get 1960s hair if I have short hair?</p><p>A: Yes!
