Male pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in men, affecting around 50% of men by the age of 50. Female pattern baldness is less common, but it can still occur in women as they age.</p><p>Other causes of hair loss include stress, poor nutrition, and certain hair styling practices. For example, wearing tight hairstyles like braids or ponytails can cause hair loss over time.</p><h2 id="age">Age and Hair Loss</h2><p>The age at which you start losing your hair can vary based on genetics and other factors. In general, men tend to start losing their hair in their 20s or 30s, while women may start experiencing thinning hair in their 40s or 50s.</p><p>However, it's important to note that hair loss can occur at any age. Some people may start losing their hair in their teens or early 20s due to genetics or other factors.</p><h2 id="prevention">Preventing Hair Loss</h2><p>While you can't always prevent hair loss, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk. Eating a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help keep your hair healthy and strong.
