Female pattern baldness is less common, but it can still occur in women as they age.</p><p>Other causes of hair loss include stress, poor nutrition, and certain hair styling practices. For example, wearing tight hairstyles like braids or ponytails can cause hair loss over time.</p><h2 id="age">Age and Hair Loss</h2><p>The age at which you start losing your hair can vary based on genetics and other factors.
