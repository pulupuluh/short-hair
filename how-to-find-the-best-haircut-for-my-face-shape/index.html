There are six basic face shapes: round, oval, square, heart-shaped, diamond-shaped, and long. Here's how to determine which one you have.</p><h3>Round Face</h3><p>If you have a round face, your face will be about as wide as it is long. Your jawline will be rounded rather than angled, and your cheekbones will be the widest part of your face.</p><h3>Oval Face</h3><p>If you have an oval face, your face will be longer than it is wide. Your jawline will be slightly rounded, and your cheekbones will be the widest part of your face.</p><h3>Square Face</h3><p>If you have a square face, your face will be about as wide as it is long. Your jawline will be squared off rather than rounded, and your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline will all be about the same width.</p><h3>Heart-Shaped Face</h3><p>If you have a heart-shaped face, your forehead will be the widest part of your face, and your face will gradually taper down to a narrow chin. Your cheekbones may be high and prominent.</p><h3>Diamond-Shaped Face</h3><p>If you have a diamond-shaped face, your forehead and jawline will be narrow, and your cheekbones will be the widest part of your face.</p><h3>Long Face</h3><p>If you have a long face, your face will be longer than it is wide.
