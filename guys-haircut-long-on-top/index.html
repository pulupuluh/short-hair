This style can be worn with a variety of hair textures and can be styled in many different ways, making it a versatile choice for men.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're interested in getting a guys haircut long on top, the first step is to find a skilled barber or stylist who can create the look for you. When you go in for your appointment, bring a picture of the style you want so that your stylist can see exactly what you're looking for. From there, the process will vary depending on your hair type and the specific style you want. In general, though, your stylist will likely use clippers to taper or fade the sides and back, leaving the hair on top longer. They may also use scissors to trim and shape the longer hair on top.</p><h3>Step by Step:</h3><p>1. Find a skilled barber or stylist.</p><p>2. Bring a picture of the style you want.</p><p>3.
