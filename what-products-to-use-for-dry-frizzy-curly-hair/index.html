Curly hair tends to be drier than straight hair because the natural oils produced by the scalp have a harder time traveling down the hair shaft due to its shape. Frizz occurs when the hair cuticle is raised, allowing moisture to enter and causing the hair to swell.</p><p>Using the right hair products can help to combat dryness and frizz and enhance your natural curls.

Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel, which can cause frizz.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to your damp hair, using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to distribute the product evenly. This will help to define your curls and provide moisture.</li><li>Style your hair as desired, using a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your curls without causing frizz. You can also air dry your hair if you have time.</li><li>Finish with a hair oil or serum to add shine and tame any flyaways.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Managing Dry Frizzy Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for managing dry frizzy curly hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it is dry, as this can cause breakage and frizz.
