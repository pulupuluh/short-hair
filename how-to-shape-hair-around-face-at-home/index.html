Do you want to change up your look but don't want to spend a fortune at the salon? Shaping your hair around your face can make a big difference in your overall appearance. In this article, we'll show you how to shape your hair around your face at home with easy-to-follow steps and tips. </p><h2> How to Shape Hair Around Face at Home </h2><p>Before we get started, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a comb, hair clips, and a pair of scissors. Second, start with clean, dry hair. This will make it easier to see where you need to cut. </p><h3> Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape </h3><p>Before you start cutting, it's important to determine your face shape. There are four basic face shapes: oval, round, square, and heart-shaped. Each shape requires a different type of cut. </p><h3> Step 2: Section Your Hair </h3><p>Next, section your hair. Take a comb and divide your hair into three sections: the top section, the sides, and the back. Secure each section with a hair clip. </p><h3> Step 3: Cut the Sides </h3><p>Start with the sides. Unclip one side of your hair and comb it forward. Hold the hair between your index and middle finger and cut straight across. Repeat on the other side. </p><h3> Step 4: Cut the Top </h3><p>Unclip the top section of your hair and comb it forward. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut at an angle, starting with a longer length at the front and gradually getting shorter towards the back. </p><h3> Step 5: Cut the Back </h3><p>Finally, unclip the back section of your hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut straight across. </p><h2> Tips for Shaping Hair Around Face </h2><p>Now that you know how to shape your hair around your face, here are some tips to keep in mind: </p><ul><li>Start with small cuts. You can always cut more, but you can't put hair back once it's been cut.</li><li>Use sharp scissors. Dull scissors can cause split ends and damage your hair.</li><li>Don't cut too much at once. It's better to make several small cuts than one big one.</li><li>Take breaks. If you're feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, take a break and come back to it later.</li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> How often should I shape my hair around my face?</h3><p>It depends on how fast your hair grows and how much you want to change your look. Generally, it's recommended to get a haircut every 6-8 weeks.</p><h3> Can I shape my hair around my face with curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, but it's important to be extra careful. Curly hair tends to bounce up after it's been cut, so it's best to cut it when it's dry.</p><h3> Should I cut my hair wet or dry?</h3><p>It's generally best to cut your hair when it's dry. This will give you a better idea of how your hair will look once it's styled.</p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>After you've shaped your hair around your face, it's important to take care of it. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner, and avoid using too much heat on your hair. You can also use a hair mask once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</p><p>Shaping your hair around your face can be a fun way to change up your look. With the right tools and techniques, you can do it yourself at home. Just remember to take it slow, be patient, and have fun!</p></article>
