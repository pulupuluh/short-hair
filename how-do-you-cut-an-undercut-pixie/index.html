This hairstyle features shaved sides and longer hair on top, creating a unique and eye-catching look. But how do you cut an undercut pixie? In this article, we'll take you through the steps to achieve this style, as well as some tips and tricks to make it look its best.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>An undercut pixie is a hairstyle where the sides and back of the head are shaved or cut very short, while the top of the head is left longer. This creates a dramatic contrast between the two lengths, and can be styled in various ways to create a unique look. The undercut pixie is a popular choice for women who want to try something bold and edgy, and is often seen as a symbol of empowerment and self-expression.</p><h2>How to Cut an Undercut Pixie</h2><p>Before you start cutting, it's important to have the right tools. You'll need a set of clippers, scissors, a comb, and some hair clips to section off the hair. Here's how to cut an undercut pixie:</p><h3>Step 1: Section off the hair</h3><p>Start by sectioning off the top of the hair, using clips to keep it out of the way. You want to leave enough hair on top to create the pixie look, so make sure you don't clip too much.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the sides and back</h3><p>Using the clippers, shave or cut the sides and back of the head. You can choose how short you want to go, but keep in mind that the shorter you go, the more dramatic the contrast will be with the longer hair on top.</p><h3>Step 3: Blend the top and sides</h3><p>Using scissors, blend the top and sides together to create a seamless transition. You want the hair to look natural and not too choppy, so take your time with this step.</p><h3>Step 4: Style the top</h3><p>Now it's time to style the top of the hair. You can leave it long and tousled, or slick it back for a more polished look. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for you.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting an Undercut Pixie</h2><p>Here are some tips to make your undercut pixie look its best:</p><ul><li>Choose a style that flatters your face shape</li><li>Leave enough hair on top to create a pixie look</li><li>Take your time blending the top and sides</li><li>Experiment with different styles to find what works best for you</li><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape and style</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting an undercut pixie:</p><h3>How short should I go on the sides?</h3><p>You can go as short as you like, but keep in mind that the shorter you go, the more dramatic the contrast will be with the longer hair on top. It's best to start with a longer length and work your way shorter if you want to go more extreme.</p><h3>What face shapes are best for an undercut pixie?</h3><p>An undercut pixie can work for any face shape, but you may want to choose a style that flatters your particular features. For example, if you have a round face, you may want to leave more hair on top to create a longer, more elongated look.</p><h3>Can I do an undercut pixie at home?</h3><p>While it's possible to do an undercut pixie at home, it's best to leave it to a professional if you're not experienced with cutting hair. The contrast between the short sides and long top can be tricky to get right, and you don't want to end up with a lopsided or uneven look.</p><h2>Hair Care for an Undercut Pixie</h2><p>To keep your undercut pixie looking its best, it's important to take good care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that's designed for your hair type</li><li>Apply a styling product to the top of the hair to keep it in place</li><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape and style</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as this can damage the hair</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine if you're swimming</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you're ready to rock an undercut pixie like a pro. Whether you're looking for a dramatic change or just want to try something new, this bold and edgy hairstyle is sure to turn heads.</p></article>
