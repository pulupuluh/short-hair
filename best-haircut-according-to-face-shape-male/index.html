There are six common face shapes for men:</p><ul><li>Oval</li><li>Square</li><li>Round</li><li>Heart</li><li>Diamond</li><li>Triangle</li></ul><p>To determine your face shape, stand in front of a mirror and use a measuring tape to measure the following:</p><ul><li>Forehead width</li><li>Cheekbone width</li><li>Jawline width</li><li>Face length</li></ul><p>Once you have your measurements, compare them to the following:</p><ul><li>Oval: Face length is greater than the width of the cheekbones, and forehead is greater than the jawline.</li><li>Square: All measurements are fairly similar.</li><li>Round: Cheekbones and face length have a similar measurement. They are larger than forehead and jawline, which also have a similar measurement.</li><li>Heart: Forehead is larger than the cheekbones and jawline. The chin is pointed.</li><li>Diamond: Face length is the largest measurement. Then, in descending order: cheekbones, forehead, and smallest is the jawline.</li><li>Triangle: Jawline is larger than the cheekbones or forehead, which are relatively similar in size.</li></ul><p>Now that you've determined your face shape, let's move on to the best haircuts according to face shape for males.</p><h3 id="oval">Best Haircuts for Oval Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oval face shape, you're in luck! This face shape is the most versatile when it comes to haircuts. You can pretty much pull off any style. However, we recommend keeping the sides short and the top longer to create volume. You can try a classic crew cut, a side part, or a messy fringe.</p><h3 id="square">Best Haircuts for Square Face Shape</h3><p>For the square face shape, we recommend a haircut that softens the sharp angles. You can try a textured crop, a side part, or a messy fringe. Avoid haircuts that are too short on the sides or too long on top, as they can emphasize the squareness of your face.</p><h3 id="round">Best Haircuts for Round Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a round face shape, you want to create the illusion of length. We recommend a haircut with short sides and a long top, such as a pompadour or a quiff. This will add height to your face and make it appear longer. Avoid haircuts that are too short on top or too long on the sides, as they can make your face look wider.</p><h3 id="heart">Best Haircuts for Heart Face Shape</h3><p>For the heart face shape, you want to balance out the width of your forehead and the narrowness of your jawline. We recommend a haircut with volume on top and shorter sides, such as a messy fringe or a textured crop. You can also try a side part, as it can create the illusion of a wider jawline.</p><h3 id="diamond">Best Haircuts for Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>The diamond face shape is similar to the heart face shape, but with a more angular jawline. You want to soften the angles with a haircut that adds volume to the top and keeps the sides short, such as a messy fringe or a textured crop. Avoid haircuts that are too short on top, as they can emphasize the sharpness of your face.</p><h3 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips</h3><p>Now that you've found the perfect haircut, it's important to take care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a shampoo that suits your hair type.</li><li>Use conditioner to keep your hair soft and hydrated.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as blow dryers or straighteners.</li><li>Get regular haircuts to keep your style looking fresh.</li><li>Use hair products, such as pomade or wax, to style your hair.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><h4>What if I have a receding hairline?</h4><p>If you have a receding hairline, we recommend a haircut that keeps the sides short and the top longer, such as a messy fringe or a textured crop. You can also try a buzz cut or a shaved head.</p><h4>Can I still try a haircut that doesn't suit my face shape?</h4><p>Of course! These are just recommendations. You should always try what you feel comfortable with and what suits your personality. However, keep in mind that certain haircuts can emphasize or downplay certain features of your face.</p><h4>How often should I wash my hair?</h4><p>It depends on your hair type and lifestyle. If you have oily hair, you may need to wash it every day. If you have dry hair, you can wash it every few days. If you exercise regularly, you may need to wash your hair more often.</p><p>And that's it! We hope this guide on the best haircut according to face shape for males has been helpful. Remember to take care of your hair and experiment with different styles. Your hair is a reflection of your personality, so have fun with it!</p></article>
