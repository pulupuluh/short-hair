It's best to use an epilator in the evening, as your skin may be red and irritated for a few hours after use. Start by choosing a small area to epilate, like your upper lip or chin.</p><p>Hold the epilator at a 90-degree angle to your skin and move it in the direction of hair growth. Use short, quick strokes to avoid pulling the skin. You may need to go over the same area a few times to remove all the hair.
