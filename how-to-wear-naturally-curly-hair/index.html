Here are some ways to style and wear your curls:</p><h3>1. Let it air dry</h3><p>Ditch the blow dryer and let your curls air dry for a more natural look. After washing your hair, gently squeeze out any excess water with a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Then, apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream and scrunch your hair upward to encourage your curls to form.</p><h3>2. Use a diffuser</h3><p>If you’re short on time, use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to speed up the drying process. This will help to reduce frizz and enhance your curls. Make sure to use a low or medium heat setting and avoid touching your hair too much while drying.</p><h3>3. Style with a headband or scarf</h3><p>Add some flair to your curly hair by styling it with a headband or scarf.
