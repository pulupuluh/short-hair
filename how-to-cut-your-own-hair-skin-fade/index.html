Start at the bottom of your head and work your way up, going against the grain. Be sure to use a comb to lift and hold the hair, so that the clippers can easily cut through it. Continue this process until you have trimmed the hair to a uniform length.</p><h3 id="step3">Step 3: Fade the Sides</h3><p>Next, switch to a number 1 guard and begin to fade the sides. Start at the bottom of your head and work your way up, creating a gradient effect. Be sure to blend the hair evenly, using the clipper over comb technique. This will ensure a seamless transition from short to long hair.</p><h3 id="step4">Step 4: Blend the Top</h3><p>Once you have faded the sides, it's time to blend the top. Use scissors to cut the hair on top to the desired length. Be sure to use a comb to lift and hold the hair as you cut. Next, use the clipper over comb technique to blend the top with the sides.</p><h3 id="step5">Step 5: Refine the Look</h3><p>After you have cut the hair to the desired length, it's time to refine the look.

However, it is generally recommended to cut your hair every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and style.</p><h3>Q: What if I make a mistake?</h3><p>A: Don't panic!
