Do you want to add some life and movement to your locks? If so, you may want to consider cutting layers into your hair. Layers can add volume, texture, and dimension to long hair, making it much more interesting to look at and style. But, how can you cut layers in long hair yourself, without having to go to a salon and spend a fortune? The answer is simple: follow our DIY guide and use Youtube as your teacher. </p><h2> Description </h2><p>Learning how to cut layers in long hair yourself Youtube can be a bit intimidating at first, but with the right tools and techniques, it's actually quite easy to do.

These include sharp hair cutting scissors, a comb, sectioning clips, and a mirror. You may also want to have a spray bottle filled with water, to mist your hair as you cut it. </p><h3> Step 2: Section Your Hair </h3><p>Next, you'll want to section your hair into manageable pieces. Start by parting your hair down the middle, and then dividing it into two sections. Clip the top section of hair out of the way, and focus on the bottom section first. </p><h3> Step 3: Cut the Bottom Layer </h3><p>Using your comb and scissors, trim the bottom layer of your hair to the desired length. This will be the foundation layer for your layers. Be sure to cut straight across, and avoid angling the scissors upward or downward, as this can create uneven layers. </p><h3> Step 4: Cut the Middle Layer </h3><p>Release the top section of your hair, and clip the freshly cut bottom layer out of the way. Next, take a section of hair from the middle of your head, and comb it straight up. Using the bottom layer as a guide, cut this section of hair to the same length. </p><h3> Step 5: Cut the Top Layer </h3><p>Finally, release the top layer of your hair, and once again clip the freshly cut middle layer out of the way. Take a section of hair from the top of your head, and comb it straight up. Using the middle layer as a guide, cut this section of hair to the same length. </p><h2> Tips </h2><p>Here are a few tips to help you achieve the best possible result when cutting layers in long hair yourself Youtube: </p><ul><li>Take your time, and don't rush the process. </li><li>Use sharp scissors, as dull ones can create split ends. </li><li>Don't cut too much off at once.
