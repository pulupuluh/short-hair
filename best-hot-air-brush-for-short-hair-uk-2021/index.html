In this article, we will be reviewing some of the best hot air brushes available in the UK market in 2021. We will be discussing their features, pros and cons, and what makes them stand out. So, without further ado, let's dive in!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A hot air brush is a versatile styling tool that combines the functions of a hair dryer and a brush. It is designed to help you achieve a salon-worthy blowout at home in a matter of minutes. If you have short hair, a hot air brush can be a game-changer for you. It can add volume, texture, and shape to your hair without damaging it. However, not all hot air brushes are created equal. Some are better suited for short hair than others.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Hot Air Brush for Short Hair UK 2021</h2><p>Before we dive into the reviews, let's first discuss some factors to consider when choosing a hot air brush for short hair:</p><h3>Barrel Size</h3><p>The barrel size of a hot air brush is an important factor to consider, especially if you have short hair.
