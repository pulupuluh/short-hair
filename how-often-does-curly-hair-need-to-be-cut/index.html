This timeframe allows for the hair to grow out just enough to avoid any drastic changes in length while also keeping the hair healthy by trimming off any split ends. However, this timeframe may vary depending on the individual's hair type, length, and styling routine.</p><p>If you have shorter hair or a pixie cut, you may need to get it cut more frequently, about every 4-6 weeks. This is because shorter hair tends to show more wear and tear, and the shorter length requires more maintenance to keep it looking fresh.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have longer hair or are trying to grow your hair out, you may be able to go a little longer between cuts, up to 10-12 weeks.
