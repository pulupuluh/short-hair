However, not everyone knows how to tell what shape their face is. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to tell what shape your face is male. We will also provide you with tips on how to take care of your hair based on your face shape. Let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Tell What Shape Your Face is Male</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Hair Care Based on Your Face Shape</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Tell What Shape Your Face is Male</h2><p>The first step in determining your face shape is to pull your hair back and away from your face. It's easier to see your face's shape when your hair is not in the way. Stand in front of a mirror and take a good look at the shape of your face. There are six basic face shapes: oval, round, square, oblong, diamond, and heart.</p><h3>Oval Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oval face shape, your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead is slightly wider than your jawline. Your cheekbones are also high and prominent. People with oval faces can pull off almost any hairstyle since their face shape is well-balanced.</p><h3>Round Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a round face shape, your face is roughly as wide as it is long. Your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, and your jawline is soft and rounded. People with round faces should avoid hairstyles that add volume on the sides, as this can make their face look wider.</p><h3>Square Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a square face shape, your face is roughly as wide as it is long. Your jawline is sharp and angular, and your forehead is wide. People with square faces should avoid hairstyles that are too short on the sides, as this can accentuate their angular jawline.</p><h3>Oblong Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oblong face shape, your face is longer than it is wide, but your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are roughly the same width. People with oblong faces should avoid hairstyles that are too long, as this can make their face look even longer.</p><h3>Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a diamond face shape, your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, and your forehead and jawline are narrow. People with diamond faces should avoid hairstyles that add volume on the sides, as this can make their cheekbones look even wider.</p><h3>Heart Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a heart face shape, your forehead is wider than your jawline, and your chin is pointed. People with heart faces should avoid hairstyles that are too short on the sides, as this can make their forehead look even wider.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know the six basic face shapes, let's go through a step-by-step guide on how to tell what shape your face is male:</p><ol><li>Pull your hair back and away from your face.</li><li>Stand in front of a mirror and take a good look at the shape of your face.</li><li>Determine if your face is oval, round, square, oblong, diamond, or heart-shaped.</li><li>Take note of your prominent features, such as the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline.</li><li>Look at the proportions of your face, such as the ratio of your forehead to your chin.</li><li>Take note of any asymmetry in your face, such as a crooked nose or uneven eyebrows.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Hair Care Based on Your Face Shape</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, here are some tips on how to take care of your hair:</p><ul><li>If you have an oval face shape, you can pull off almost any hairstyle.</li><li>If you have a round face shape, avoid hairstyles that add volume on the sides.</li><li>If you have a square face shape, avoid hairstyles that are too short on the sides.</li><li>If you have an oblong face shape, avoid hairstyles that are too long.</li><li>If you have a diamond face shape, avoid hairstyles that add volume on the sides.</li><li>If you have a heart face shape, avoid hairstyles that are too short on the sides.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>1.
