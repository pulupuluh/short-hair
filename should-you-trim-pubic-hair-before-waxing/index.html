The answer to this question is not straightforward, as it depends on the length of your hair and the type of wax you'll be getting.</p><p>Generally speaking, it's a good idea to trim your pubic hair a few days before your waxing appointment. This will make the process easier for the esthetician and reduce the discomfort you feel during the waxing process.

Make sure the scissors are sharp and clean.</p><h3>Step 2: Comb Your Pubic Hair</h3><p>Use the comb to gently comb your pubic hair in the direction of growth. This will help to separate the hairs and make it easier to trim them.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Trimming</h3><p>Using the scissors, start trimming the hairs that are longer than a quarter of an inch. Take your time and trim the hair in small sections, making sure not to cut too much at once.</p><h3>Step 4: Check Your Progress</h3><p>After you've finished trimming, use the comb to check for any stray hairs that you may have missed.
