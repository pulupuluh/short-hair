Flat irons are designed to straighten hair by applying heat to the hair shaft, which breaks down the hydrogen bonds that cause hair to curl.</p><p>Before you begin straightening your hair, it is important to prepare your hair by washing and conditioning it with products that are designed for your hair type. You should also apply a heat protectant product to your hair to prevent damage from the heat of the flat iron.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Straighten Short Curly Hair with a Flat Iron</h2><p>Follow these simple steps to straighten short curly hair with a flat iron:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Begin by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that are designed for your hair type.
