Your body needs essential nutrients to support the growth of your baby and to keep your hair healthy. Make sure to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats in your diet. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks as they do not provide any nutritional value.</p><h3>Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress can cause hair fall. During pregnancy, your body goes through many changes, and it can be stressful. Take some time for yourself to relax and unwind. Practice meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to manage stress.</p><h3>Use a Mild Shampoo</h3><p>Using a mild shampoo can prevent hair fall during pregnancy. Choose a shampoo that is gentle on your hair and scalp. Avoid shampoos that contain harsh chemicals as they can damage your hair.</p><h3>Avoid Heat Styling Tools</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons, curling irons, and hair dryers can damage your hair and cause hair fall. Avoid using heat styling tools during pregnancy and let your hair air dry.
