This haircut is also known as a graduated bob or an inverted bob.</p><h3>Who can get a Stacked Haircut?</h3><p>A stacked haircut can flatter all face shapes and hair types. It is a versatile haircut that can be customized to suit your preferences. However, it is best suited for people with medium to thick hair as it can add volume and texture to the hair.
