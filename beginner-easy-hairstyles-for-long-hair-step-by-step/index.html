Whether you're a beginner or just looking for some quick and easy hairstyles to add to your repertoire, we've got you covered. In this article, we're going to share some beginner easy hairstyles for long hair step by step, so you can look great without spending hours on your hair.</p><h2> Description </h2><p>Are you tired of the same old ponytail or bun? Do you want to try something new and stylish? Look no further! We've compiled a list of beginner easy hairstyles for long hair step by step that you can try out at home. From braids to twists, these hairstyles are perfect for any occasion and will make you feel confident and beautiful.</p><h2> How to </h2><p>Before we get started, make sure you have some basic hair tools on hand, such as a brush, comb, hair elastics, and bobby pins. You may also want to use some styling products, such as hairspray or mousse, to help hold your hair in place. </p><h3> Simple Twisted Half-Up Hairstyle </h3><p>To start, brush your hair and create a part in the middle. Take a small section of hair from the front on one side and twist it away from your face. Do the same on the other side. Then, take the two twists and cross them over each other in the back. Use a bobby pin to secure the twists in place. </p><h3> Easy Braided Crown </h3><p>Take a small section of hair at the front of your head and braid it. Then, bring the braid over to the other side of your head and secure it with bobby pins. Repeat on the other side. Once both braids are in place, tuck the ends under and secure them with bobby pins. </p><h3> Messy Bun </h3><p>Put your hair in a high ponytail and secure it with an elastic. Then, twist the ponytail around the base to create a bun. Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place. Pull out a few pieces of hair around your face to create a messy, effortless look. </p><h3> Classic French Braid </h3><p>Divide your hair into three sections at the top of your head. Cross the right section over the middle section, then the left section over the middle section. As you continue braiding, add more hair from the sides until you've incorporated all your hair. Secure the end of the braid with an elastic. </p><h2> Step by Step </h2><p>Now that you know the basics, let's go through each hairstyle step by step. </p><h3> Simple Twisted Half-Up Hairstyle </h3><ol><li>Brush your hair and create a part in the middle.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the front on one side and twist it away from your face.</li><li>Do the same on the other side.</li><li>Cross the two twists over each other in the back and secure with a bobby pin.</li></ol><h3> Easy Braided Crown </h3><ol><li>Take a small section of hair at the front of your head and braid it.</li><li>Bring the braid over to the other side of your head and secure it with bobby pins.</li><li>Repeat on the other side.</li><li>Tuck the ends under and secure with bobby pins.</li></ol><h3> Messy Bun </h3><ol><li>Put your hair in a high ponytail and secure it with an elastic.</li><li>Twist the ponytail around the base to create a bun.</li><li>Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place.</li><li>Pull out a few pieces of hair around your face to create a messy, effortless look.</li></ol><h3> Classic French Braid </h3><ol><li>Divide your hair into three sections at the top of your head.</li><li>Cross the right section over the middle section, then the left section over the middle section.</li><li>As you continue braiding, add more hair from the sides until you've incorporated all your hair.</li><li>Secure the end of the braid with an elastic.</li></ol><h2> Tips </h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use a texturizing spray or dry shampoo to give your hair some grip and hold.</li><li>Don't worry if your hairstyle isn't perfect – messy and imperfect styles are on-trend right now.</li><li>Experiment with different accessories, such as headbands, barrettes, or scarves, to add some extra flair to your hairstyle.</li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about beginner easy hairstyles for long hair:</p><h3> Q: How do I keep my hair from falling out of a braid?</h3><p> A: You can use a small amount of hairspray or texturizing spray before braiding to help hold your hair in place. You can also use bobby pins to secure any loose pieces.</p><h3> Q: Can I still do these hairstyles if I have shorter hair?</h3><p> A: Some of these hairstyles may work for shorter hair, but you may need to modify them slightly. For example, you could do a half-up hairstyle with a shorter section of hair at the front, or create a smaller bun with a shorter ponytail. </p><h3> Q: How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p> A: It depends on your hair type and personal preference, but most people can get away with washing their hair every two to three days. Over-washing can strip your hair of its natural oils and cause damage.</p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>Finally, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, and use a heat protectant spray when you do use hot tools.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends and breakage.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and nutrients to promote strong, healthy hair.</li></ul><p>With these beginner easy hairstyles for long hair step by step, you'll be able to switch up your look and feel confident in no time. Experiment with different styles and have fun!</p></article>
