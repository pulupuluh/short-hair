This iconic hairstyle is a timeless choice that can be worn for any event or occasion. In this guide, we will show you how to create the perfect 40s pin up hair look in just a few easy steps. From victory rolls to pin curls, we’ve got you covered. Let’s get started!</p><h2>How to</h2><p>The key to achieving a flawless 40s pin up hair look is to have the right tools and products on hand. You will need a rat tail comb, bobby pins, hair spray, and a curling iron. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Before you begin styling your hair, make sure it is clean and dry. This will help your hair hold its shape and prevent any unwanted frizz. If your hair tends to be oily, use dry shampoo to absorb any excess oil.</p><h3>Step 2: Divide your hair</h3><p>Using your rat tail comb, divide your hair into two sections. The first section should be from your temples to the crown of your head, and the second section should be from the crown to the nape of your neck.</p><h3>Step 3: Create victory rolls</h3><p>Start with the first section of your hair and create two victory rolls on each side of your head. To create a victory roll, take a small section of hair and roll it towards your head. Secure it in place with bobby pins. Repeat on the other side of your head.</p><h3>Step 4: Create pin curls</h3><p>Next, move onto the second section of your hair and create pin curls. Take a small section of hair and wrap it tightly around your finger. Slide the hair off your finger and secure it in place with bobby pins. Repeat until all of your hair is in pin curls.</p><h3>Step 5: Set your hair</h3><p>Once all of your hair is in pin curls, spray it with hair spray to help set the style. Leave the pin curls in place for at least 30 minutes or until your hair is completely dry.</p><h3>Step 6: Remove the pin curls</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, remove the bobby pins from the pin curls. Gently brush out your hair with a soft bristle brush to create soft waves.</p><h3>Step 7: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>To finish the look, spray your hair with hairspray to help hold the style in place. You can also add a decorative hair accessory, such as a flower or scarf, for an extra touch of glamour.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you achieve the perfect 40s pin up hair look:</p><ul><li>Practice makes perfect! Don’t be discouraged if your first attempt doesn’t turn out perfectly. Keep practicing and you will get the hang of it.</li><li>Use a setting lotion or mousse to help your hair hold its shape.</li><li>If you have short hair, use hair extensions or a wig to achieve the look.</li><li>Experiment with different hair accessories to add your own personal touch to the style.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about 40s pin up hair:</p><h3>What type of hair works best for this style?</h3><p>This style works best on medium to long hair with some texture. If your hair is too fine, use a volumizing product to help give it more body.</p><h3>How long does this style last?</h3><p>This style can last for several days if you use enough hairspray and take care not to disturb the curls.</p><h3>Can I achieve this style without a curling iron?</h3><p>Yes, you can achieve this style without a curling iron by using rag curls or foam rollers instead.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>It’s important to take care of your hair to prevent damage and breakage. Here are some tips for keeping your hair healthy:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to help prevent dryness.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often.</li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water to keep your hair healthy from the inside out.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to do 40s pin up hair, you can rock this classic look with confidence. Whether you’re attending a formal event or just want to add some retro flair to your everyday style, this look is sure to turn heads. Happy styling!</p></article>
