For thick coarse hair, a larger barrel will help create looser, bouncier curls.</li><li>Bristle strength: Look for a brush with strong bristles that can grip your hair without pulling or snagging.</li><li>Material: Ceramic or tourmaline brushes are excellent choices for thick coarse hair, as they emit negative ions that help smooth and tame frizz.</li></ul><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Using a Round Brush</h3><p>Now that you've found the perfect round brush for your hair, it's time to put it to use.
