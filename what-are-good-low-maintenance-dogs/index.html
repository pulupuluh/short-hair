They are perfect for busy owners or those who simply don't have the time or energy to devote to high-maintenance breeds. These dogs typically have short coats, low energy levels, and are relatively independent.

Some key factors to consider include:</p><ul><li>Your living situation (apartment, house, etc.)</li><li>Your work schedule</li><li>Your activity level</li><li>Your budget (some breeds can be more expensive than others)</li></ul><p>It's also important to research breeds and their specific needs. While all low maintenance dogs require less grooming and exercise than high-maintenance breeds, some may still require more attention than others.

They have short coats and only require moderate exercise. They are also very calm and easy-going, making them great for families.</p><h3>4.
