Your face shape plays a significant role in determining which hairstyles will complement your features. There are six common face shapes: </p><ul><li> Oval </li><li> Round </li><li> Square </li><li> Heart </li><li> Diamond </li><li> Oblong </li></ul><p> To determine your face shape, stand in front of a mirror and pull your hair back. Take note of the shape of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. </p><h3 id="hair-texture"> Understanding Your Hair Texture </h3><p> Another important factor to consider when choosing a hairstyle is your hair texture. Hair texture refers to the thickness and density of your hair. There are three main hair textures: </p><ul><li> Fine </li><li> Medium </li><li> Coarse </li></ul><p> To determine your hair texture, run your fingers through your hair. If you can feel individual strands and they are thin, you likely have fine hair. If your hair feels thicker and more substantial, you may have medium or coarse hair. </p><h3 id="personal-style"> Considering Your Personal Style </h3><p> Your personal style is also an essential factor to consider when choosing a hairstyle.
