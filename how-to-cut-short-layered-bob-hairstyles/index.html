This will give the bob haircut a more modern and edgy look. Here are the basic steps to follow when cutting a short layered bob:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair. This will help you see the natural shape and texture of your hair. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start cutting.</p><h3>Step 2: Separate Hair into Sections</h3><p>Separate your hair into sections by parting it down the middle and then from ear to ear. Use hair clips to hold each section in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Back Section</h3><p>Start with the back section of your hair. Use a comb to lift a small section of hair and cut it straight across. Repeat this process for the entire back section of your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Side Sections</h3><p>Move on to the side sections of your hair. Use the back section as a guide and cut each side section at an angle. This will create layers that frame your face.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Layers</h3><p>Use scissors to blend the layers together by cutting into the hair at an angle. This will create a seamless transition between the layers.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for Balance</h3><p>Check your hair for balance by looking in the mirror and making sure both sides are even. Make any necessary adjustments.</p><h3>Step 7: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Finally, style your hair as desired.
