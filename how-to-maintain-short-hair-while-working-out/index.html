Use a Sweatband or Headband</h3><p>Sweat can be one of the biggest enemies of short hair. If you're working out and you start to sweat, your hair can become wet and matted. To prevent this, use a sweatband or headband to keep the sweat off your face and hair. This will help to keep your hair dry and prevent it from getting tangled or matted.</p><h3>2. Tie Your Hair Back</h3><p>If your hair is short enough to tie back, do it! Tying your hair back will keep it out of your face while you work out.
