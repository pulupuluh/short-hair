Hair type refers to the texture and curl pattern of your hair. There are four main hair types: type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 4. Each hair type has subcategories based on the size of the curl pattern. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Tell Your Natural Hair Type</h2><p>The easiest way to determine your hair type is to look at your natural hair when it is completely dry, free of product, and has not been manipulated in any way. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Look at the Shape of Your Curl Pattern</h3><p>The shape of your curl pattern will determine your hair type. Type 1 hair is straight, while type 2 hair has a slight wave. Type 3 hair has a loose curl pattern, and type 4 hair has a tight curl pattern. </p><h3>Step 2: Determine the Size of Your Curl Pattern</h3><p>Once you've determined your hair type, you'll need to determine the size of your curl pattern. Type 2 hair has three subcategories: 2A, 2B, and 2C. Type 3 hair has three subcategories: 3A, 3B, and 3C. Type 4 hair has three subcategories: 4A, 4B, and 4C. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to determining your natural hair type:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup.</li><li>Allow your hair to air dry completely without using any styling products or heat tools.</li><li>Look at the shape of your curl pattern to determine your hair type.</li><li>Determine the size of your curl pattern to determine the subcategory of your hair type.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when determining your hair type:</p><ul><li>Be patient. It may take a few tries to accurately determine your hair type.</li><li>Ask for help. If you're having trouble determining your hair type, ask a friend or a hair care professional for assistance.</li><li>Take note of any changes. Your hair type may change over time due to factors such as age, hormones, and lifestyle changes.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about determining your natural hair type:</p><h3>What if my hair has multiple curl patterns?</h3><p>If your hair has multiple curl patterns, choose the one that is most prevalent throughout your hair.</p><h3>What if I have heat damage or chemical damage?</h3><p>If you have heat damage or chemical damage, it may be more difficult to determine your natural hair type. In this case, it's best to consult with a hair care professional.</p><h3>What if I have fine hair?</h3><p>If you have fine hair, your hair type will still fall within one of the four categories. Fine hair simply refers to the thickness of each individual strand of hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Once you've determined your natural hair type, you can select the right hair care products and styling methods to keep your hair healthy and beautiful.
