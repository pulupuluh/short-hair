When you don't shave your pubic hair, it can become longer and thicker, which can lead to some uncomfortable side effects.</p><p>One of the most common consequences of not shaving your pubic hair is irritation and itching.

Avoid using harsh soaps or scrubbing too hard, as this can further irritate the skin.</p><p>You can also use a comb or brush to gently detangle any knots or mats in your pubic hair.
