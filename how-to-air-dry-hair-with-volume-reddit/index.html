However, many people struggle with achieving volume when air drying their hair. If you’re looking for tips on how to air dry hair with volume reddit, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we’ll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to air dry your hair to achieve maximum volume.</p><h2>How to Air Dry Hair with Volume Reddit</h2><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>The first step to achieving volume when air drying your hair is to start with clean hair. Shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would, making sure to use products that are designed for your hair type. If you have fine hair, use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to help boost volume.</p><h3>Step 2: Towel Dry Your Hair</h3><p>After washing your hair, gently towel dry it to remove excess water. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel, as this can cause damage and frizz. Instead, gently blot your hair with the towel to remove water.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply a Volumizing Product</h3><p>Next, apply a volumizing product to your hair. This can be a mousse, spray, or cream. Choose a product that is specifically designed to add volume to your hair. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the roots.</p><h3>Step 4: Flip Your Hair Upside Down</h3><p>One of the best ways to add volume to your hair when air drying is to flip your hair upside down. This helps to lift your roots and create volume. Lean your head forward and shake your hair out, then use your fingers to scrunch your hair at the roots.</p><h3>Step 5: Let Your Hair Air Dry</h3><p>Once you’ve applied your volumizing product and flipped your hair upside down, let your hair air dry. Avoid touching your hair too much, as this can cause frizz and disrupt the volume you’ve created. If you’re in a rush, you can use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to speed up the drying process.</p><h3>Step 6: Flip Your Hair Back Up</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, flip your hair back up and use your fingers to gently shake out any excess product. This will help to create a more natural look and prevent your hair from looking stiff or crunchy.</p><h2>Tips for Air Drying Hair with Volume Reddit</h2><p>Here are a few additional tips to help you achieve maximum volume when air drying your hair:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair before air drying</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your hair</li><li>Avoid touching your hair too much while it’s drying</li><li>Try sleeping with your hair in a loose bun to help create natural volume</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Can I air dry my hair overnight?</h3><p>Yes, you can air dry your hair overnight. However, it’s important to make sure your hair is completely dry before going to bed to avoid damaging your hair or creating frizz.</p><h3>How long does it take for hair to air dry?</h3><p>The amount of time it takes for hair to air dry depends on several factors, including hair type, length, and thickness. On average, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours for hair to air dry completely.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Air drying your hair is a great way to keep it healthy and prevent heat damage. However, it’s important to use the right products and techniques to achieve maximum volume. Follow the steps and tips outlined in this article to achieve the perfect air-dried, voluminous hairstyle.</p></article>
