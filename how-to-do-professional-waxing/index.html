You'll need wax, wax strips, a wax warmer, and a spatula. You can find these supplies at most beauty supply stores or online.</p><p>Once you have your supplies, you'll want to prep your skin for waxing.

Follow the instructions on your wax to determine the appropriate temperature. Be sure to stir the wax occasionally to ensure it's evenly heated.</p><h3>Step 2: Test the Temperature</h3><p>Before applying the wax to your skin, test the temperature on the inside of your wrist. The wax should be warm but not too hot. If it's too hot, let it cool down for a few minutes before testing it again.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply the Wax</h3><p>Using the spatula, apply the wax to the area you want to wax in the direction of hair growth. Apply a thin layer of wax, making sure to leave a clean edge for easy removal.</p><h3>Step 4: Apply the Wax Strip</h3><p>Place a wax strip over the wax and smooth it down in the direction of hair growth. Be sure to leave a clean edge for easy removal.</p><h3>Step 5: Remove the Wax Strip</h3><p>Hold your skin taut with one hand and use the other hand to remove the wax strip quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth.
