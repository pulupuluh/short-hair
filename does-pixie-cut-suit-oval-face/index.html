This is because the short length of the haircut draws attention to the face and can make it appear wider.</p><h3>What face shape is best suited for a pixie cut?</h3><p>A pixie cut can suit a variety of face shapes, including round, heart, and square faces. However, it is important to choose the right length and style for your face shape.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Here are some tips for taking care of your pixie cut:</p><ul><li>Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can damage it.</li><li>Use a styling product to keep your pixie cut in place and add some texture.</li><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape of your haircut.</li></ul><p>So, there you have it.
