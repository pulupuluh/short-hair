Here are some basic steps to follow:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Wavy curly hair tends to be dry, so it needs extra moisture to look and feel its best.</li><li>Towel-dry your hair gently, being careful not to rub it too hard. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair while it's still damp.</li><li>Apply a styling product that's specifically designed for wavy curly hair. This could be a curl cream, mousse, or gel. Work the product through your hair from roots to tips, making sure to distribute it evenly.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. This will help define your curls and reduce frizz. If you don't have a diffuser, you can air-dry your hair instead.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, you can add some finishing touches. You may want to apply a little bit of hair oil or serum to add shine and reduce frizz.
