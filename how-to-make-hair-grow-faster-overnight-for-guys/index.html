In this article, we will provide you with all the information you need to help your hair grow faster and healthier.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Before we dive into the specifics of making hair grow faster overnight, let's first discuss some basic information about hair growth. On average, hair grows about 0.5 inches per month, or 6 inches per year. Hair growth is affected by various factors, such as genetics, age, diet, and overall health.
