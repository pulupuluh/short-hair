Use the longest guard first and gradually work your way down to a shorter guard until you achieve the desired length.</p><p>Next, use scissors to blend the hair at the top of the fade into the longer hair on the top of your head. Use a comb to lift the hair and cut it at an angle to create a natural-looking blend.</p><h3>Step 4: Refine Your Look</h3><p>Once you've achieved your desired length and blended your hair, it's time to refine your look.
