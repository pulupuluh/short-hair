It is one of the most popular haircuts for men, as it is easy to maintain and can be styled in a variety of ways.

Blend the top and sides with the clippers by using the guard to fade the hair at the sides and back. <br/>6. Use scissors to trim any remaining longer hairs on the top of your head. <br/>7.
