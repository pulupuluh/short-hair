This versatile style looks great on almost any face shape and hair texture. Plus, it's low-maintenance and easy to style at home.

It's characterized by choppy, textured layers that give the hair movement and volume. Here are the basic steps for cutting a shaggy bob:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Before you begin cutting, make sure your hair is clean and dry. This will help you see the natural texture and movement of your hair, which is important for creating a shaggy bob. You can shampoo and blow-dry your hair, or simply air-dry it.</p><h3>2. Section your hair</h3><p>Use a comb to create a center part down the middle of your head. Then, divide your hair into four equal sections: two in the front and two in the back. Clip each section out of the way with hair clips.</p><h3>3. Cut the back sections</h3><p>Starting with the back sections, take one section at a time and comb it straight down. Hold your scissors vertically and make small, diagonal cuts into the hair. Don't cut straight across – this will create a blunt line. Instead, aim for a choppy, textured look. Repeat this process for each back section.</p><h3>4. Cut the front sections</h3><p>Next, move on to the front sections. Take one section at a time and pull it forward. Use your fingers to guide the hair as you make small, diagonal cuts with your scissors. This will help create face-framing layers. Repeat this process for each front section.</p><h3>5. Check for balance</h3><p>Once you've cut all four sections, check for balance. Use a mirror to view your hair from all angles. Make any necessary adjustments to the length or texture.</p><h3>6. Style your hair</h3><p>Now that you've cut your shaggy bob, it's time to style it. You can air-dry your hair for a natural, tousled look, or use a curling iron or flat iron to create waves or straighten your hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide for cutting a medium shaggy bob:</p><h3>1. Gather your tools</h3><p>You'll need a few tools to cut your shaggy bob, including:</p><ul><li>Sharp scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Hair clips</li><li>Mirror</li></ul><h3>2. Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would. Towel-dry your hair and let it air-dry or blow-dry it with a hair dryer.</p><h3>3. Create a center part</h3><p>Use a comb to create a center part down the middle of your head. Divide your hair into four sections: two in the front and two in the back. Clip each section out of the way with hair clips.</p><h3>4. Cut the back sections</h3><p>Start with the back sections. Take one section at a time and comb it straight down.
