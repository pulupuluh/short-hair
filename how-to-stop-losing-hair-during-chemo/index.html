Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely to cause hair loss than others, and your doctor can help you anticipate what to expect.</p><p>Once you have a better understanding of your treatment, you can take steps to minimize hair loss. One of the most effective ways to do this is to use a cold cap during chemotherapy. A cold cap is a special device that is worn on the head during treatment. The cap is cooled to very low temperatures, which slows down the blood flow to the scalp. This reduces the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach the hair follicles, which can prevent or minimize hair loss.</p><p>In addition to using a cold cap, you can also try taking supplements that promote hair growth. Biotin, for example, is a B vitamin that is known to support healthy hair, skin, and nails.
