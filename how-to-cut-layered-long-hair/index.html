It's best to start with clean, dry hair and use sharp scissors. You can cut your hair yourself or have a friend or professional do it for you. Follow these steps for a beautiful layered haircut:</p><h3>1. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Use a comb to create a middle part and divide your hair into two sections. Then, create a horizontal part about an inch above the bottom of your hair and clip the top section away. This will be the first layer you cut.</p><h3>2. Determine the Length of Your Layers</h3><p>Decide how long you want your layers to be. For longer layers, cut less hair; for shorter layers, cut more hair. Use the first layer you cut as a guide for the rest of your hair.</p><h3>3. Cut the First Layer</h3><p>Hold the first layer of hair between your fingers and cut it straight across. You can use a comb to guide your scissors and ensure a straight cut. Be sure to keep your fingers parallel to the floor to maintain the length you want.</p><h3>4. Cut the Rest of Your Layers</h3><p>Move up to the next layer of hair and repeat the process, using the first layer as a guide. Continue cutting layers until you reach the top section of your hair.</p><h3>5. Blend Your Layers</h3><p>After you've cut all your layers, use your scissors to blend the ends of your hair.
