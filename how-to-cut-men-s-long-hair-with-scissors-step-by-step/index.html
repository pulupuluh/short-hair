You should also wash and dry the hair to ensure it is clean and free of tangles.</p><p>It is also important to have a clear idea of the desired hairstyle and length. You can use pictures or videos as a reference to guide you during the cutting process.</p><h3 id="section1">Sectioning the Hair</h3><p>Sectioning the hair is essential to ensure an even cut. Start by dividing the hair into four equal sections: two at the front and two at the back. Secure each section with hair clips.</p><p>Next, take a small section of hair from one of the front sections and comb it straight.

Take a small section of hair from one of the back sections and comb it straight. Hold it between your fingers and cut off a small amount of hair at a time, working your way down the length of the hair.</p><p>Continue this process for each section, making sure to cut the hair evenly on both sides. Take breaks as needed to rest your hands and assess your progress.</p><h3 id="section3">Blending the Hair</h3><p>After trimming the hair, you need to blend it to create a seamless transition between the different sections. To do this, take a small section of hair from one of the front sections and comb it straight. Hold it between your fingers and cut off a small amount of hair at a time, working your way towards the back.</p><p>Repeat this process for each section, making sure to cut the hair evenly on both sides. Use the comb to blend any uneven areas and ensure a smooth transition between the sections.</p><h3 id="section4">Final Touches</h3><p>Once you have blended the hair, you can make any final touches to the length and style. Use the scissors to trim any stray hairs or uneven sections.
