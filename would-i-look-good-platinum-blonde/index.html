However, if done correctly, platinum blonde can be a stunning and head-turning look.</p><h2>How to Go Platinum Blonde</h2><p>If you've decided that you want to go platinum blonde, it's important to go to a professional colorist. Bleaching your hair to this extreme shade can be damaging, and it's crucial to have an experienced stylist who knows how to minimize the damage. Your colorist will likely need to bleach your hair multiple times to achieve the desired level of lightness, and they will also need to tone your hair to remove any brassy tones.</p><h3>Step by Step Guide:</h3><p>1.
