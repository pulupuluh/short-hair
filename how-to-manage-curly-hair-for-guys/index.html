Apply the product to damp hair and scrunch it in with your hands.</p><h3>4. Don't Over Style</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons and blow dryers too often. These can damage your hair and make it frizzy. Instead, let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer.</p><h3>5.
