There are six main face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and oblong. To determine your face shape, stand in front of a mirror and pull your hair back away from your face. Then, use a measuring tape to measure the following:</p><ul><li>Forehead: Measure the width of your forehead at the widest point, which is usually just above your eyebrows.</li><li>Cheeks: Measure the width of your cheeks at the widest point, which is usually around the center of your face.</li><li>Jawline: Measure the width of your jawline at the widest point, which is usually just below your ears.</li><li>Face Length: Measure the length of your face from the center of your forehead to the bottom of your chin.</li></ul><p>Once you have these measurements, you can use them to determine your face shape:</p><ul><li>Oval: If your face length is approximately one and a half times the width of your forehead, and your forehead, cheeks, and jawline are roughly the same width, you have an oval face shape.</li><li>Round: If your face length is approximately the same as the width of your face, and your cheeks are the widest part of your face, you have a round face shape.</li><li>Square: If your forehead, cheeks, and jawline are roughly the same width, and your face length is about the same as the width of your face, you have a square face shape.</li><li>Heart: If your forehead is wider than your cheeks and jawline, and your chin is pointed, you have a heart-shaped face.</li><li>Diamond: If your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, and your forehead and jawline are narrower, you have a diamond face shape.</li><li>Oblong: If your face length is longer than your forehead, and your forehead, cheeks, and jawline are roughly the same width, you have an oblong face shape.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Choosing a Hairstyle</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, it's time to choose a hairstyle that will complement your features.
