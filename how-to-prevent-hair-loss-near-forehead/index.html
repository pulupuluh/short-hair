Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of protein, vitamins, and minerals that are essential for healthy hair, such as iron, zinc, and biotin.</p><h3>4.

Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to manage stress levels and prevent hair loss.</p><h3>5.
