The best method for you will depend on the length of your hair, your personal style, and the look you’re going for. Here are some of the most popular techniques:</p><h3>Pull it Back</h3><p>The easiest way to keep your curly hair out of your face is to pull it back. You can do this in a variety of ways, from a simple ponytail to a more elaborate updo. Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li>Start by brushing your hair to remove any tangles.</li><li>Gather your hair at the nape of your neck or higher up, depending on where you want your ponytail to sit.</li><li>Tie your hair back with an elastic band or hair tie. You can leave it as a simple ponytail or add twists, braids, or other embellishments.</li><li>Secure any loose strands with bobby pins or hair clips.</li></ol><p>Another option for pulling your hair back is to create a half-up, half-down style. This is a great way to keep your hair out of your face while still showing off your beautiful curls. Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li>Start by separating the top section of your hair from the bottom section.</li><li>Tie the top section back with an elastic band or hair tie.</li><li>Leave the bottom section loose and curly.</li><li>Add twists, braids, or other embellishments to the top section for a more elaborate look.</li><li>Secure any loose strands with bobby pins or hair clips.</li></ol><h3>Pin it Up</h3><p>If you don’t want to pull your hair back completely, you can still keep it out of your face by pinning it up.
