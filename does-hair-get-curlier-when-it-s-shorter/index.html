Keep reading to learn more about this topic.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Hair texture is determined by genetics, and it can vary from person to person. Some people have straight hair, while others have wavy or curly hair. However, hair texture can also change due to environmental factors, such as humidity, sun exposure, and chemical treatments.</p><p>When it comes to the length of your hair, the general rule of thumb is that shorter hair appears curlier than longer hair. This is because the weight of long hair can pull the curls down, making them appear looser. On the other hand, shorter hair doesn't have as much weight, so the curls can bounce up, creating a curlier appearance.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you want to test whether your hair will get curlier when it's shorter, you can try cutting a few inches off and seeing how your hair reacts. Keep in mind that the results may vary depending on your hair type, so it's best to consult with a stylist before making any drastic changes.</p><p>If you have straight or wavy hair and want to enhance your curls, you can try using curl-enhancing products or getting a perm.
