Baldness was also associated with leprosy and other skin diseases, which were often considered a punishment from God.</p><p>However, baldness was not always viewed negatively in the Bible. In some cases, it was a symbol of dedication and devotion to God. For example, the Nazirites were required to shave their heads as a sign of their consecration to God.

When David learns of Saul and Jonathan's deaths, he tears his clothes and mourns, and the men who accompany him shave their heads as a sign of mourning. Similarly, when Job loses his wealth, health, and family, he shaves his head and tears his clothes in grief.</p><p>In other cases, baldness is a symbol of shame and judgment. In Isaiah 3:17, the Lord rebukes the daughters of Zion for their haughty behavior, saying, "The Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will uncover their secret parts."
