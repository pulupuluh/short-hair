Look for products that are specifically formulated for curly hair, as they will help enhance your natural texture.</li><li>Gently towel-dry your hair.

Work the product through your hair with your fingers, using a wide-tooth comb to detangle any knots. Make sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</li><li>Flip your head upside down and use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair. Hold the diffuser close to your scalp and scrunch your hair upward to encourage your curls to form. Use a low heat setting to avoid damaging your hair.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron or wand to touch up any areas that need more definition. Take small sections of hair and wrap them around the barrel of the curling iron or wand, holding for a few seconds before releasing. Use a heat protectant spray before using hot tools to protect your hair from damage.</li><li>Finish with a light hold hairspray to help your curls hold their shape.
