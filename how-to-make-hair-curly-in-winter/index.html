Then, divide your hair into sections and apply a styling product. Next, roll each section of hair around a roller, securing it in place. Leave the rollers in your hair for a few hours, or overnight. When you remove the rollers, you will have beautiful, bouncy curls.</p><h3>Braids</h3><p>Braiding your hair is a great way to make it curly without using heat or tools. Start by washing and drying your hair. Then, divide your hair into sections and braid each section tightly. Leave the braids in your hair for a few hours or overnight.
