But with the right techniques and products, you can keep your curls looking great for weeks. Here are some tips on how to maintain soft dread curls:</p><h3>1. Moisturize your hair regularly</h3><p>Moisture is key when it comes to maintaining soft dread curls. Relaxed hair tends to be dry and brittle, which can cause your curls to lose their shape. To avoid this, make sure to moisturize your hair regularly. Use a leave-in conditioner or moisturizer to keep your hair hydrated.</p><h3>2. Avoid using heat</h3><p>Heat can damage your hair and cause your curls to lose their shape. Avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons or curling irons. Instead, opt for heatless styling methods like bantu knots or perm rods to maintain your curls.</p><h3>3. Use a satin pillowcase</h3><p>Sleeping on a cotton pillowcase can cause your hair to lose moisture and create frizz. To avoid this, use a satin pillowcase. Satin is a smooth and soft material that reduces friction and helps to keep your curls intact.</p><h3>4. Don't over-wash your hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip away its natural oils and cause it to become dry and brittle.
