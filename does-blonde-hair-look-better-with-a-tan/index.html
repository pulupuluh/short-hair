However, the question remains: do they look better together? The answer is subjective and depends on personal preference, but there are some things to consider when it comes to the two looks. Blonde hair can complement a tan by brightening up the face and highlighting the golden tones in the skin.

For blonde hair, you can either dye your hair or use a temporary hair color spray. If you're unsure about committing to permanent hair dye, a temporary option may be the way to go. As for the tan, you can either get a natural tan by spending time in the sun, or use a self-tanner to achieve the desired look.
