Do you have fine hair that seems to break or get damaged easily? If so, investing in a high-quality hair straightener can be a game-changer for you. However, with so many options available in the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. In this article, we'll be discussing the best straighteners for fine hair in 2020 that will give you salon-worthy results without damaging your hair. </p><h2>How to Choose the Right Straightener for Fine Hair?</h2><p>Before we dive into the list of best straighteners for fine hair, let's first understand what features you should look for while choosing a straightener. </p><h3>Plate Material:</h3><p>The material of the plates can impact the health of your hair. Ceramic plates are a popular choice as they distribute heat evenly and have a smoother surface that reduces the risk of hair damage. Titanium plates are also great for fine hair as they heat up quickly and retain heat well.</p><h3>Temperature:</h3><p>High temperatures can damage fine hair, so it's important to choose a straightener with adjustable temperature settings. Look for a straightener that has a maximum temperature of 350-380 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h3>Size:</h3><p>The size of the plates can impact how well the straightener works on your hair. For fine hair, it's best to go for a straightener with narrow plates that can glide smoothly through the hair. </p><h2>Top 5 Best Straighteners for Fine Hair 2020</h2><h3>1. BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Ultra-Thin Straightening Iron</h3><p>The BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium-Plated Ultra-Thin Straightening Iron is a top choice for fine hair.

Slowly glide the straightener down the length of the hair, making sure to keep the plates parallel to each other.
