They are low maintenance and can last for years. People with all hair types, including relaxed hair, can wear dreadlocks. However, many people wonder if it is possible to dreadlock relaxed hair. In this article, we will explore the answer to this question and provide you with all the information you need to know about dreadlocking relaxed hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Dreadlocks are rope-like strands of hair that form when hair is left to grow and tangle naturally. They can be achieved on any hair type, but some hair types are more prone to forming dreadlocks than others. One such hair type is afro-textured hair. However, this doesn't mean that people with relaxed hair can't have dreadlocks.</p><h2>How to Dreadlock Relaxed Hair</h2><p>If you have relaxed hair and want to dreadlock it, you can follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start dreadlocking your hair, you need to prepare it. This involves washing your hair thoroughly with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup. You should also deep condition your hair to make it more pliable.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, you need to section your hair into small, even sections. The size of the sections will depend on the size of the dreadlocks you want. Use hair clips to secure each section.</p><h3>Step 3: Backcomb Your Hair</h3><p>Take one section of hair and backcomb it using a fine-toothed comb. Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Twist and Secure Your Hair</h3><p>Once you have backcombed each section of hair, twist it tightly and secure it with a rubber band or hair tie. You can also use a dreadlock wax or gel to help hold the hair in place.</p><h2>Tips for Dreadlocking Relaxed Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you dreadlock your relaxed hair:</p><ul><li>Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup from your hair.</li><li>Deep condition your hair to make it more pliable.</li><li>Use a fine-toothed comb to backcomb your hair.</li><li>Twist your hair tightly and secure it with a rubber band or hair tie.</li><li>Use a dreadlock wax or gel to help hold the hair in place.</li></ul><h2>FAQ About Dreadlocking Relaxed Hair</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about dreadlocking relaxed hair:</p><h3>Can you dreadlock relaxed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can dreadlock relaxed hair.

However, using a dreadlock wax or gel can help hold the hair in place and make the process easier.</p><h2>Hair Care for Dreadlocked Relaxed Hair</h2><p>Once you have dreadlocked your relaxed hair, you need to take care of it properly. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a residue-free shampoo.</li><li>Deep condition your hair to keep it moisturized.</li><li>Avoid using heavy oils or products that can weigh down your hair.</li><li>Retwist your hair regularly to maintain the shape of your dreadlocks.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools on your hair.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, if you have relaxed hair and want to dreadlock it, you can do so.
