Look no further! In this guide, we’ll show you the top hair styles for round face women in 2020. From bobs to bangs, we’ve got you covered.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Having a round face shape can be both a blessing and a curse. While it gives you a youthful appearance, it can also make it difficult to find the perfect hairstyle. A great hairstyle can bring out the best in your features and make you feel confident and beautiful. In this guide, we’ll show you how to choose the perfect hairstyle for your round face shape.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Hair Style for Round Face Women</h2><p>Choosing the right hairstyle for your round face shape can be a daunting task. Here are some tips to help you choose the right one:</p><h3>1. Consider Your Hair Texture</h3><p>The texture of your hair can play a big role in determining the best hairstyle for your round face. If you have fine hair, a short bob with layers can add volume and create the illusion of a longer face shape. If you have thick hair, a longer layered cut can help balance out your face shape.</p><h3>2. Think About Your Lifestyle</h3><p>When choosing a hairstyle, it’s important to consider your lifestyle. If you’re someone who is always on the go, a low maintenance hairstyle like a messy bun or a simple ponytail might be the best option for you.</p><h3>3. Consider Your Personal Style</h3><p>Your personal style should also be taken into consideration when choosing a hairstyle. If you’re someone who loves to experiment with different looks, a bold and edgy hairstyle might be the perfect fit for you. If you prefer a more classic and timeless look, a simple bob or a shoulder-length cut might be the best choice.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide: Top Hair Styles for Round Face Women in 2020</h2><h3>1. The Long Bob</h3><p>The long bob, also known as the "lob," is a versatile hairstyle that looks great on round face women. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for a shoulder-length cut with long layers. This will help elongate your face shape and add movement to your hair. Use a curling iron to add loose waves for a more textured look.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great option for round face women. They help draw the attention away from the width of your face and create a more balanced look. Ask your stylist for long, side-swept bangs that blend seamlessly with the rest of your hair.</p><h3>3. The Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut is a bold and edgy hairstyle that looks great on round face women with short hair. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for a short cut with choppy layers. Use a texturizing spray to add volume and create a more textured look.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Hair Style</h2><p>Once you’ve found the perfect hairstyle for your round face, it’s important to take care of it. Here are some tips for maintaining your hair style:</p><h3>1. Use the Right Products</h3><p>Using the right products can make a big difference in maintaining your hair style. Invest in a high-quality shampoo and conditioner that is specifically formulated for your hair type. Use a styling product to help keep your hair in place throughout the day.</p><h3>2.

Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protecting your hair from damage is crucial for maintaining your hair style. Use a heat protectant spray before using hot tools like curling irons or flat irons. Wear a hat or use a scarf to protect your hair from the sun.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>1.
