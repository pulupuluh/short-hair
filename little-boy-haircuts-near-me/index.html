This will help prevent damage and breakage.</p><h3>Trim Regularly</h3><p>Regular trims will help keep the hair looking neat and tidy. Aim for a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep the hair looking its best.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Little Boy Haircuts</h2><h3>What is the best haircut for a toddler boy?</h3><p>The best haircut for a toddler boy depends on their hair type and lifestyle.
