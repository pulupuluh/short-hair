Here are the techniques you can use to reduce the volume:</p><h3>1. Use a Concentrator Nozzle</h3><p>Attach the concentrator nozzle to your blow dryer to focus the air flow on a specific section of your hair. This will help you to control the direction of your hair and reduce volume.</p><h3>2. Use a Paddle Brush or Round Brush</h3><p>Using a paddle brush or round brush, start blow drying your hair by pulling your hair downwards. This will help to straighten your hair and reduce the volume. Make sure you keep the brush close to your hair to avoid frizz.</p><h3>3. Use a Low Heat Setting</h3><p>Using a low heat setting on your blow dryer can help to reduce the volume of your hair. High heat can cause your hair to become frizzy and voluminous.</p><h2 id="cool">Cool Shot</h2><p>Once you have blow dried your hair, use the cool shot button on your blow dryer to cool down your hair. This will help to set your hair and reduce any remaining volume.</p><h2 id="finish">Finishing Touches</h2><p>Once your hair is completely dry, you can add some finishing touches to reduce the volume. Apply a small amount of hair serum or oil to your hair to smooth out any frizz.
