Look for short, fine hairs around the hairline or the crown of your head. These new hairs may be lighter in color and texture than your existing hair.</p><h3>Less Hair Fall</h3><p>If you notice less hair fall when you brush or wash your hair, it is an indication that your hair loss has slowed down.

Use natural hair care products or products that are gentle on your hair.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protect your hair from sun damage, wind, and cold temperatures. Wear a hat or use a scarf to cover your hair when you are outside.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can hair thinning be reversed?</h3><p>Yes, hair thinning can be reversed in some cases.
