This will help you determine which hair colors and highlights will complement your natural features the best. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>If you have warm undertones (yellow or golden), opt for warm hair colors such as golden blonde or auburn.</li><li>If you have cool undertones (pink or blue), choose cool hair colors such as ash blonde or black.</li><li>If you have a neutral undertone, you can pull off both warm and cool hair colors.</li><li>Consider your eye color as well. If you have blue eyes, warm hair colors will make them pop. If you have brown eyes, cool hair colors will complement them.</li></ul><p>Once you've determined your skin tone and eye color, it's time to consider your personal style. Do you prefer a natural look or something more bold? Are you willing to commit to regular touch-ups or do you want something low-maintenance? Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>If you want a natural look, opt for hair colors that are close to your natural shade. You can add subtle highlights for dimension.</li><li>If you want something bold, consider bright colors such as red or purple. You can also opt for dramatic highlights such as blonde or platinum.</li><li>If you want something low-maintenance, choose a hair color that is close to your natural shade. This will make regrowth less noticeable.</li><li>If you don't mind regular touch-ups, choose a hair color that is drastically different from your natural shade. This will require more maintenance but can make a big impact.</li></ul><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h3><p>Here are the steps to follow when picking the right hair color and highlights:</p><ol><li>Determine your skin tone and eye color.</li><li>Consider your personal style and maintenance preferences.</li><li>Browse hair color options and choose a few that you like.</li><li>Consult with a hairstylist to determine which hair color and highlights will work best for you.</li><li>Book an appointment and get your new hair color and highlights!</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Consider the season.
