However, some people worry that blonde hair can make their face look bigger, which can be a concern for those with round or square face shapes.

Other factors, such as hairstyle and face shape, play a more significant role in how your face appears.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>If you have a round or square face shape, you may want to consider choosing a blonde shade that complements your skin tone and features. For example, if you have warm undertones, a honey or caramel blonde shade may be more flattering than a cool-toned platinum blonde. On the other hand, if you have cool undertones, a silvery or ashy blonde may suit you better.</p><p>When it comes to hairstyles, there are several options that can help balance out the proportions of your face. A layered haircut can add volume and movement to your hair, which can create the illusion of a slimmer face.
