Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you choose the perfect short hairstyle:</p><ol><li>Consider your hair texture. If you have fine hair, a short bob or pixie cut can add volume and dimension to your hair. If you have thick hair, a short layered cut can help to thin out your hair.</li><li>Choose a style that softens your strong jawline.
