However, they are not as uncommon as some people believe. </p><h3>Q: Can green eyes change color?</h3><p>A: Yes, some people with green eyes may notice that their eye color changes depending on lighting or what they are wearing.

Eye color is simply a genetic trait that is determined by the amount and type of pigments in the iris. </p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Green-Eyed Beauties</h2><p>If you have green eyes, you may want to consider changing up your hair color to complement your eye color.
