Most women over 60 also wear glasses, which can make choosing the right hairstyle a bit challenging. But that doesn't mean you have to settle for boring hair. There are plenty of short hairstyles that can make you look stylish and sophisticated. Here are some of the best short hairstyles for 60 year old woman with glasses.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short hairstyles are perfect for women over 60 because they are easy to maintain and can take years off your appearance. They are also versatile and can be customized to suit your face shape and personal style. Short haircuts can range from a pixie cut to a bob, with layers, side-swept bangs, and asymmetrical cuts being popular options.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>The first step in choosing a short hairstyle is to consider your face shape. Oval faces can wear almost any short hairstyle, while round faces look best with layers and side-swept bangs to create the illusion of length. If you have a square face, go for a bob with soft layers to soften your features. Heart-shaped faces look great with chin-length bobs or pixie cuts with side-swept bangs.</p><p>Once you know your face shape, you can start looking for inspiration. Check out magazines, websites, and social media for short hairstyles that catch your eye. Make a list of your favorites and take them to your stylist. They can help you choose the best option for your face shape and lifestyle.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>1. Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are designed for your hair type.</p><p>2. Blow-dry your hair using a round brush to add volume and texture.</p><p>3. Use a straightening iron to smooth out any frizz or flyaways.</p><p>4. Apply styling product to your hair, such as mousse or hairspray, to hold your style in place.</p><p>5. Use a comb or your fingers to style your hair into the desired shape.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>- If you have glasses, consider getting a haircut that frames your face and complements your frames.</p><p>- Ask your stylist for a cut that is easy to maintain and style.</p><p>- Consider using hair accessories, such as headbands or hair clips, to add interest to your hairstyle.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Q: Can I still have long hair after 60?</p><p>A: Of course! Long hair can be beautiful at any age. However, it may require more maintenance to keep it looking healthy and vibrant.</p><p>Q: Are there any short hairstyles that are off-limits for women over 60?</p><p>A: No, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to hair. However, it's important to choose a style that makes you feel confident and comfortable.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>As we age, our hair becomes more delicate and requires extra care.
