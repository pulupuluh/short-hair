One of the main culprits is humidity. When there is moisture in the air, your hair can absorb it, causing the strands to swell and become frizzy. Another factor is the heat from your straightening iron. If the iron is too hot or if you apply too much heat to your hair, it can cause damage to the cuticles, which can lead to frizz.</p><h3 id="section2">How to Prevent Frizz When Straightening Hair</h3><p>The best way to prevent frizz when straightening hair is to start with clean, dry hair. Make sure to use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner that are designed to smooth and hydrate hair. You can also use a heat protectant spray or serum to help protect your hair from the heat of your straightening iron. Additionally, try to avoid using your straightening iron on humid or damp days, as this can exacerbate frizz.</p><h3 id="section3">Step by Step Guide for Straightening Hair</h3><p>If you're new to straightening your hair, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair, then towel dry it gently.</li><li>Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair, then comb it through to distribute evenly.</li><li>Plug in your straightening iron and allow it to heat up.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections, starting at the bottom and working your way up.</li><li>Take a small section of hair and clamp the straightening iron onto it, starting as close to the roots as possible without burning yourself.</li><li>Slowly glide the straightening iron down the length of the hair, making sure to keep the iron moving at a steady pace.</li><li>Repeat this process with each section of hair until all of your hair is straightened.</li><li>Finish by applying a smoothing serum or oil to your hair to add shine and prevent frizz.</li></ol><h3 id="section4">Tips for Managing Frizz After Straightening Hair</h3><p>Even if you take all the necessary steps to prevent frizz when straightening your hair, you may still experience some frizz once your hair is straightened.
