There are four main face shapes: round, square, oval, and heart-shaped.

Long, layered hair can also be flattering on a round face.</p><h3>What hairstyle suits a square face?</h3><p>Hairstyles that soften the jawline, such as a side-swept bang or loose waves, can be flattering on a square face. Shoulder-length hair can also help balance out a square face.</p><h3>What hairstyle suits an oval face?</h3><p>An oval face shape is considered the most versatile, and many hairstyles can be flattering. However, a center part and long, layered hair can highlight an oval face's natural symmetry.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Once you have chosen a hairstyle, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it looking its best. Here are some tips for hair care:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as blow dryers or straighteners</li><li>Use hair masks or treatments to keep your hair healthy and moisturized</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends</li></ul><p>By following these tips, you can ensure that your hair looks its best and that your chosen hairstyle is maintained over time. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing the right hairstyle can make a big difference in your appearance and confidence.
