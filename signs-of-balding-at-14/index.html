These patches can be small or large, and may be accompanied by itching or irritation.

Eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and managing stress can all help to keep your hair healthy. Avoiding hairstyles that pull on the hair, such as tight braids or ponytails, can also help to prevent hair loss. Additionally, using gentle hair care products and avoiding harsh chemicals can help to keep your hair strong and healthy.</p><h2>What to Do if You're Experiencing Hair Loss</h2><p>If you're noticing signs of balding at 14, it's important to speak with your doctor.
