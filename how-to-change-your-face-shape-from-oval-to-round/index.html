An oval face shape is characterized by a narrow forehead, prominent cheekbones, and a narrow chin. On the other hand, a round face shape is characterized by a wider forehead, fuller cheeks, and a more rounded chin. Changing your face shape from oval to round can be achieved through a combination of makeup techniques, hairstyles, and facial exercises. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Change Your Face Shape from Oval to Round</h2><p>There are several ways to change your face shape from oval to round, including:</p><h3>1. Use Makeup Techniques</h3><p>Makeup can be a powerful tool for changing your face shape. To create the illusion of a rounder face, use contouring techniques to create shadows along your cheekbones and jawline, and highlight the center of your face. Use a blush with a round, circular motion on the apples of your cheeks to create a fuller look. </p><h3>2. Try Facial Exercises</h3><p>Facial exercises can help tone and strengthen the muscles in your face, which can help create a more rounded appearance. Try exercises like puckering your lips and holding for a few seconds, or smiling while pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth. </p><h3>3. Change Your Hairstyle</h3><p>Your hairstyle can greatly affect the appearance of your face shape. For a rounder look, try hairstyles with volume at the crown of your head, like a bob or layered cut. Avoid hairstyles that emphasize the length of your face, like long, straight hair. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to change your face shape from oval to round:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step in changing your face shape is to determine your current face shape.
