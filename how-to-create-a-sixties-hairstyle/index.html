In this article, we'll show you how to create a sixties hairstyle that will make you look like you've stepped out of a time machine. From the beehive to the bouffant, we'll cover all the popular sixties hairstyles that you can recreate at home. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The sixties was a decade of change, rebellion, and innovation. The fashion and hairstyles of this era reflected this spirit of change. Sixties hairstyles were bold, voluminous, and often involved teasing and hairspray. The beehive, the bouffant, and the pixie cut were some of the most popular hairstyles of the sixties. </p><h2>How to</h2><p>To create a sixties hairstyle, you'll need some basic hairstyling tools such as a teasing comb, hair spray, bobby pins, and hair ties. Here's how you can create some of the most popular sixties hairstyles:</p><h3>The Beehive</h3><p>The beehive is a classic sixties hairstyle that requires a lot of teasing and hairspray. To create a beehive, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Start by sectioning your hair into three parts – the crown, the sides, and the back.</li><li>Take the crown section and tease it with a teasing comb to create volume.</li><li>Smooth the teased hair with a comb and secure it with bobby pins.</li><li>Repeat the same process with the sides and the back sections.</li><li>Once you've finished teasing and pinning all the sections, spray your hair with hairspray to hold the beehive in place.</li></ol><h3>The Bouffant</h3><p>The bouffant is another popular sixties hairstyle that involves a lot of teasing and hairspray. Here's how you can create a bouffant:</p><ol><li>Start by sectioning your hair into two parts – the top and the bottom.</li><li>Tease the top section of your hair with a teasing comb to create volume.</li><li>Smooth the teased hair with a comb and secure it with bobby pins.</li><li>Leave some hair out in the front to create a fringe.</li><li>Take the bottom section of your hair and tie it into a ponytail.</li><li>Tease the ponytail with a teasing comb to create volume.</li><li>Smooth the teased hair with a comb and wrap it around the base of the ponytail to create a bun.</li><li>Secure the bun with bobby pins.</li><li>Once you've finished teasing and pinning all the sections, spray your hair with hairspray to hold the bouffant in place.</li></ol><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Creating a sixties hairstyle can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to hairstyling. Here's a step-by-step guide that will help you create a sixties hairstyle:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start styling your hair, make sure that it's clean and dry. Apply some heat protectant spray to your hair to protect it from heat damage. </p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into the desired sections depending on the hairstyle you want to create. Use hair ties or clips to keep the sections separate.</p><h3>Step 3: Tease Your Hair</h3><p>Take a section of hair and tease it with a teasing comb to create volume. Start at the roots and work your way down. Repeat this process with all the sections of hair that you want to tease.</p><h3>Step 4: Smooth Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've teased your hair, use a comb to smooth the teased hair. This will create a polished look and help to keep the style in place.</p><h3>Step 5: Pin Your Hair</h3><p>Use bobby pins to secure the teased hair in place. Make sure that the pins are hidden and not visible.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Once you've pinned your hair, spray it with hairspray to hold the style in place. Use a strong hold hairspray for best results.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips that will help you create the perfect sixties hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use a teasing comb to tease your hair. A regular comb won't give you the same level of volume.</li><li>Don't be afraid to use a lot of hairspray. Sixties hairstyles require a lot of hold to keep them in place.</li><li>Practice makes perfect. If you're new to hairstyling, it may take a few tries to get the perfect sixties hairstyle.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about sixties hairstyles:</p><h3>Q: Can I create a sixties hairstyle with short hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can create a sixties hairstyle with short hair. The pixie cut was a popular sixties hairstyle for women with short hair.</p><h3>Q: Do I need special tools to create a sixties hairstyle?</h3><p>A: You don't need any special tools to create a sixties hairstyle. A teasing comb, bobby pins, and hairspray are all you need.</p><h3>Q: Are sixties hairstyles suitable for everyday wear?</h3><p>A: Sixties hairstyles are more suitable for special occasions or events. They require a lot of time and effort to create, so they're not practical for everyday wear.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Creating a sixties hairstyle can be damaging to your hair, especially if you use a lot of heat and hairspray. Here are some tips to keep your hair healthy:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using any heat styling tools.</li><li>Limit your use of hairspray to prevent build-up and damage to your hair.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair hydrated and healthy.</li></ul><p>Creating a sixties hairstyle is a fun and exciting way to switch up your look. With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to create the perfect sixties hairstyle at home. So, grab your teasing comb and hairspray and get ready to rock a sixties hairstyle!</p></article>
