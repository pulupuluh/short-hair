Here are some tips on how to achieve that look:</p><h3>1. Use the Right Products</h3><p>Invest in hair products that are specifically designed to add volume and texture to your hair. Look for shampoos, conditioners, and styling products that are labeled as volumizing, thickening, or texturizing. These products typically contain ingredients that coat the hair strands and make them appear fuller and thicker.</p><h3>2. Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow drying your hair is an effective way to add volume and texture. Use a hair dryer on a low heat setting and focus on the roots of your hair. Lift your hair up with your fingers as you blow dry to create more volume. </p><h3>3. Use a Round Brush</h3><p>Using a round brush while blow drying can also help create volume. Wrap sections of your hair around the brush and pull it upwards as you blow dry. This will create more lift and volume at the roots.</p><h3>4. Try a Mousse or Foam</h3><p>Mousses and foams are great products for adding volume to your hair. Apply the product to damp hair before blow drying to create more texture and volume.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Follow these simple steps to achieve fluffy hair:</p><h3>1.
