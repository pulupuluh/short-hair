Obesity is determined by body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.</p><h3 id="section2">Does Obesity Rate Rise with Age?</h3><p>Yes, obesity rate does rise with age. According to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2017-2018, the obesity rate among adults aged 20-39 was 28.0%, while the obesity rate among adults aged 40-59 was 40.2%. The obesity rate among adults aged 60 and over was 37.0%. This shows that as we age, the likelihood of becoming obese increases.</p><h3 id="section3">Why Does Obesity Rate Rise with Age?</h3><p>There are several reasons why the obesity rate rises with age. One of the main reasons is a decrease in metabolic rate, which is the rate at which our bodies burn calories. As we age, our metabolic rate decreases, and we require fewer calories to maintain our weight. This means that if we continue to consume the same amount of calories as we did when we were younger, we are more likely to gain weight.</p><p>Another reason why the obesity rate rises with age is a decrease in physical activity. As we age, we tend to become less active, which means that we burn fewer calories. This, combined with a decrease in metabolic rate, can lead to weight gain and obesity.</p><h3 id="section4">Health Risks Associated with Obesity</h3><p>Obesity is associated with various health risks, including:</p><ul><li>Heart disease</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>Type 2 diabetes</li><li>Stroke</li><li>Certain types of cancer</li><li>Sleep apnea</li><li>Joint problems</li></ul><h3 id="section5">How to Maintain a Healthy Weight as You Age</h3><p>Here are some tips on how to maintain a healthy weight as you age:</p><ul><li>Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains</li><li>Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks</li><li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water</li><li>Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, swimming, or cycling</li><li>Strength train to build muscle mass and increase metabolic rate</li><li>Get enough sleep to allow your body to recover and repair</li><li>Manage stress through relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga</li></ul><h3 id="section6">Conclusion</h3><p>Obesity rate does rise with age, and it is important to take steps to maintain a healthy weight as we age.
