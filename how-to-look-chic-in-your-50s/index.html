Some classic accessories to consider include a statement necklace, a structured handbag, and a pair of simple stud earrings.</p><h3>4. Experiment with Color</h3><p>Don't be afraid to experiment with color in your 50s. While black may be a go-to color, adding some vibrant hues to your wardrobe can add some fun and excitement to your outfits. Choose colors that complement your skin tone and make you feel confident.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>1.
