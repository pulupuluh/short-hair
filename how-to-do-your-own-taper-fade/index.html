If you want to learn how to do your own taper fade, you’ve come to the right place. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps for achieving a clean and sharp taper fade haircut.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A taper fade is a popular haircut style that involves gradually fading the hair from short to long, starting from the neckline and working up towards the crown of the head. This style is versatile and can be worn by men of all ages and hair types. With the right tools and technique, it’s possible to achieve a professional-looking taper fade at home.</p><h2>How To</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you begin, you’ll need to gather a few tools:</p><ul><li>Clipper</li><li>Guard attachments</li><li>Shears or scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Haircutting cape or towel</li><li>Mirror</li></ul><p>Make sure your clippers are fully charged or plugged in and that your shears are clean and sharp.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide On Your Fade Length</h3><p>Decide on the length of your fade. A “low” fade involves fading the hair down to the skin, while a “high” fade involves fading the hair down to a longer length, such as a #2 guard.</p><h3>Step 3: Start With The Hairline</h3><p>Begin by trimming the hairline around the ears and neckline to your desired length. Use a smaller guard attachment or no guard at all for a clean, precise line.</p><h3>Step 4: Choose Your Guard Attachment</h3><p>Choose your guard attachment based on the length you want for the fade. Use a longer guard attachment for a high fade and a shorter one for a low fade.</p><h3>Step 5: Start Fading</h3><p>Start by using the longest guard attachment and work your way down to the shortest one. Use a flicking motion with the clippers to blend the different lengths together. Be sure to work in small sections and use the comb to guide the clippers.</p><h3>Step 6: Blend The Sides And Back</h3><p>Blend the sides and back of the head by gradually decreasing the guard attachment length. Make sure to keep the fading line even on both sides.</p><h3>Step 7: Determine The Length Of The Top</h3><p>Determine the length you want for the top of your hair. Use your shears or scissors to trim the top to the desired length.</p><h3>Step 8: Blend The Top And Sides</h3><p>Blend the top and sides of the hair by using the scissors to cut the hair in a downward motion. This will create a natural blend between the top and sides.</p><h3>Step 9: Clean Up The Edges</h3><p>Use your clippers to clean up any stray hairs around the hairline and neckline. Use a smaller guard attachment or no guard for a precise finish.</p><h3>Step 10: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Finally, style your hair as desired. You can use a hair product such as pomade or gel to create a polished look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Take your time and work slowly to avoid mistakes.</li><li>Use a mirror to check the back of your head.</li><li>Practice makes perfect – don’t be discouraged if your first attempt isn’t perfect.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How long does a taper fade last?</h3><p>A taper fade typically lasts between two and four weeks, depending on how quickly your hair grows.</p><h3>What is the difference between a taper fade and a regular fade?</h3><p>A taper fade gradually fades the hair from short to long, while a regular fade involves fading the hair down to the skin.</p><h3>Can I do a taper fade on curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, a taper fade can be done on curly hair. You may need to use a longer guard attachment to account for the curl factor.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To maintain your taper fade haircut, you’ll need to trim it every few weeks. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Avoid using hot styling tools too often, as they can damage the hair.</p><p>Now that you know how to do your own taper fade, you can save time and money by cutting your own hair at home. With practice, you’ll be able to achieve a professional-looking fade that will turn heads.</p></article>
