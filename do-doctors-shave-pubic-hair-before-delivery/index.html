This is a common question among expectant mothers, and it's important to know the answer to help you prepare for your delivery day. In this article, we will discuss everything you need to know about pubic hair and delivery, including why doctors used to shave pubic hair, whether it is still a common practice today, and how to take care of your pubic hair during pregnancy.</p><h2>Why Did Doctors Used to Shave Pubic Hair Before Delivery?</h2><p>In the past, doctors used to shave pubic hair before delivery for several reasons. One of the main reasons was to prevent infection. When a woman delivers a baby, there is a risk of bacteria entering the vagina and causing an infection. Shaving pubic hair was thought to reduce this risk by making it easier to keep the area clean and sterile.</p><p>Another reason for shaving pubic hair before delivery was to make it easier for doctors to perform an episiotomy. An episiotomy is a surgical cut made in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) to widen the vaginal opening during delivery. Shaving pubic hair was thought to make it easier to see the perineum and perform the cut.</p><h2>Is Shaving Pubic Hair Before Delivery Still a Common Practice?</h2><p>Today, most doctors do not shave pubic hair before delivery. This is because there is no evidence that it reduces the risk of infection or makes it easier to perform an episiotomy. In fact, shaving pubic hair can actually increase the risk of infection by causing small cuts or abrasions in the skin.</p><p>Instead of shaving, doctors now recommend that women keep their pubic hair clean and trimmed. This can be done by washing the area with warm water and mild soap, and using scissors or clippers to trim the hair if desired.</p><h2>How to Take Care of Your Pubic Hair During Pregnancy</h2><p>During pregnancy, your pubic hair may grow more quickly and become thicker. This is due to hormonal changes in your body. To take care of your pubic hair during pregnancy, follow these tips:</p><h3>1. Keep it clean</h3><p>Wash your pubic hair regularly with warm water and mild soap to keep it clean and prevent infection.</p><h3>2. Trim it regularly</h3><p>Use scissors or clippers to trim your pubic hair regularly. This can help prevent tangles and make it easier to keep the area clean.</p><h3>3. Avoid shaving</h3><p>Avoid shaving your pubic hair during pregnancy. Shaving can increase the risk of infection and cause skin irritation.</p><h3>4. Wear loose clothing</h3><p>Wear loose clothing that allows your pubic hair to breathe. Tight clothing can cause irritation and make it harder to keep the area clean.</p><h3>5. See a professional</h3><p>If you want to have your pubic hair removed, see a professional. They can use safe and effective methods, such as waxing or laser hair removal.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>1. Is it safe to shave pubic hair during pregnancy?</h3><p>Shaving pubic hair during pregnancy is not recommended. It can increase the risk of infection and cause skin irritation.</p><h3>2. Do doctors still shave pubic hair before delivery?</h3><p>No, most doctors do not shave pubic hair before delivery. There is no evidence that it reduces the risk of infection or makes it easier to perform an episiotomy.</p><h3>3. How can I keep my pubic hair clean during pregnancy?</h3><p>You can keep your pubic hair clean during pregnancy by washing it regularly with warm water and mild soap, and trimming it with scissors or clippers if desired.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, doctors do not shave pubic hair before delivery anymore. It is no longer considered a necessary practice, and can actually increase the risk of infection. Instead, women are advised to keep their pubic hair clean and trimmed during pregnancy. If you have any concerns or questions about pubic hair and delivery, talk to your doctor or midwife.</p></article>
