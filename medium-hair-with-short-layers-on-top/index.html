Be careful not to rub your hair too hard, as this can cause damage and breakage.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product of your choice, such as a texturizing spray or mousse, to your damp hair. This will help to add volume and texture while also providing hold.</p><h3>Step 4: Blow Dry</h3><p>Using a round brush, blow dry your hair in sections, starting with the bottom layers and working your way up to the top layers. Be sure to lift the hair at the roots to create volume.</p><h3>Step 5: Style</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a flat iron or curling iron to add some texture and waves. You can also use a texturizing spray or pomade to add even more texture and hold.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind when styling and caring for your medium hair with short layers on top:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using any hot styling tools to prevent damage to your hair.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your layers looking fresh and prevent split ends.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find the ones that work best for your hair type and texture.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about medium hair with short layers on top:</p><h3>Is this hairstyle suitable for all hair types?</h3><p>Yes, this hairstyle works well with many different hair types, including straight, wavy, and curly hair.</p><h3>How often should I get my hair trimmed?</h3><p>It's recommended to get a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your layers looking fresh and prevent split ends.</p><h3>What styling products should I use?</h3><p>Experiment with different styling products, such as texturizing sprays, mousses, and pomades, to find the ones that work best for your hair type and texture.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for maintaining healthy, beautiful hair.
