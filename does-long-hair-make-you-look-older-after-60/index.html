As we age, our skin loses elasticity and our hair can become thinner and less vibrant. Long hair can sometimes draw attention to these changes, making us appear older than we really are. However, this is not always the case.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>When deciding if long hair is right for you after the age of 60, there are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li>Face shape: Some face shapes are more suited to long hair than others. For example, if you have a long, narrow face, long hair can help balance out your features. On the other hand, if you have a round face, long hair can sometimes make your face appear even rounder.</li><li>Hair texture: If your hair is thinning or becoming brittle, long hair may not be the best choice. Shorter hairstyles can help make your hair appear fuller and healthier.</li><li>Lifestyle: Long hair can be high maintenance, especially if you enjoy swimming, working out, or spending time outdoors.

A skilled stylist can help you find the right layers to flatter your face shape and hair texture.</li><li>Consider bangs: Bangs can help soften your features and add a touch of youthfulness to your look.</li><li>Accessorize: Hair accessories can help add interest and style to long hair. Try adding a headband or scarf to your look for a touch of glamour.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><ul><li>Consult with a stylist: A skilled stylist can help you find the right long hairstyle for your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle.</li><li>Consider your wardrobe: Long hair can sometimes clash with certain styles of clothing.
