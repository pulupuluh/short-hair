Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends, focusing on the areas where you want to add volume and texture.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to comb through your hair and distribute the mousse even further.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair using a round brush to add volume and shape. Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends, pulling your hair taut with the brush as you go.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use your fingers to tousle and arrange your hair into your desired style.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Using Weightless Mousse for Fine Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your weightless mousse:</p><ul><li>Use a small amount of mousse at first, and add more as needed.
