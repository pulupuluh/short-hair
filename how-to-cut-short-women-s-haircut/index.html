First, make sure you have the right tools on hand. You'll need a sharp pair of haircutting scissors, a comb, hair clips, and a spray bottle filled with water.

It's easier to shorten hair than to add length back.</li><li>Use your fingers to hold the hair in place while cutting, rather than a comb. This will give you a more natural, textured look.</li><li>Go slow and be patient. Cutting short hair is a precision task, and it's better to take your time than rush and make a mistake.</li><li>Don't forget to trim the hair around your ears and neckline.
