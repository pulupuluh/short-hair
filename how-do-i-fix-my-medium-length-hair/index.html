There are different types of hair, such as straight, curly, wavy, thick, and thin. Knowing your hair type will help you choose the right products and techniques to fix your hair.</p><p>Once you know your hair type, you can follow these general steps to fix your medium length hair:</p><ol><li>Start with clean and dry hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Apply a hair serum or oil to protect your hair from heat damage and add shine.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using any heat styling tools, such as a flat iron or curling wand.</li><li>Choose a hairstyle that suits your face shape and hair type.

Avoid using hot water, as it can damage your hair and make it frizzy. Rinse your hair thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel. Avoid rubbing your hair with the towel, as it can cause breakage.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Hair Serum or Oil</h3><p>Apply a hair serum or oil to protect your hair from heat damage and add shine. Use a pea-sized amount for medium length hair and distribute it evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends. Avoid applying it to your scalp, as it can make your hair look greasy.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Heat Protectant Spray</h3><p>Before using any heat styling tools, such as a flat iron or curling wand, use a heat protectant spray to prevent heat damage. Spray it evenly throughout your hair and comb it through to distribute it evenly.</p><h3>Step 4: Choose a Hairstyle</h3><p>Choose a hairstyle that suits your face shape and hair type. For example, if you have curly hair, you can try a messy bun or a braided hairstyle. If you have straight hair, you can try a sleek ponytail or a half-up, half-down hairstyle. Use hair accessories, such as hair clips, headbands, or scrunchies, to add some flair to your hairstyle.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray or Hair Oil</h3><p>Finish your hairstyle with a hairspray or hair oil to hold it in place and add shine. Use a light hold hairspray for a natural look or a strong hold hairspray for a more defined look. Apply a small amount of hair oil to the ends of your hair to add shine and prevent frizz.</p><h2 id="Tips">Tips for Fixing Your Medium Length Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you fix your medium length hair:</p><ul><li>Use a boar bristle brush to distribute the natural oils in your hair and add shine.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as it can cause damage and breakage.</li><li>Get regular trims to remove split ends and keep your hair healthy.</li><li>Try a hair mask once a week to moisturize and nourish your hair.</li><li>Avoid using too many styling products, as it can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li></ul><h2 id="FAQ">FAQ about Fixing Medium Length Hair</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about fixing medium length hair:</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my medium length hair?</h3><p>A: It depends on your hair type and lifestyle.
