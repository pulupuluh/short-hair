That's why the "what hairstyle suits me test" is a popular tool that many hairstylists and beauty experts use to help their clients find the perfect hairstyle. This test takes into account your face shape, hair texture, and personal style to recommend the most flattering hairstyle for you.

Take a good look at the shape of your face and compare it to the following descriptions: <ul><li><strong>Round:</strong> Your face is nearly as wide as it is long, with full cheeks and a rounded chin.</li><li><strong>Oval:</strong> Your face is longer than it is wide, with a gently rounded hairline and a slightly pointed chin.</li><li><strong>Square:</strong> Your face is roughly as wide as it is long, with a strong jawline and a square hairline.</li><li><strong>Heart:</strong> Your face is wider at the temples and narrows at the chin, with a pointed chin.</li><li><strong>Diamond:</strong> Your face is widest at the cheekbones and narrows at the forehead and chin.</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Determine Your Hair Texture</h3> The next step is to determine your hair texture. Hair texture refers to the natural curl pattern of your hair. There are three basic hair textures: straight, wavy, and curly. To determine your hair texture, let your hair air dry without any styling products. Take a good look at the natural curl pattern of your hair and compare it to the following descriptions: <ul><li><strong>Straight:</strong> Your hair is naturally straight and has little or no curl.</li><li><strong>Wavy:</strong> Your hair has a natural wave pattern that is visible when it air dries.</li><li><strong>Curly:</strong> Your hair has a natural curl pattern that is visible when it air dries.</li></ul><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3> Now that you've determined your face shape and hair texture, it's time to take the "what hairstyle suits me test."
