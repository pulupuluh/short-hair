Jerry curls are a classic hairstyle that can give you a retro and stylish look. In this step by step guide, we will show you how to get jerry curls, including tips and tricks for achieving the perfect curls. </p><h2>What are Jerry Curls?</h2><p>Jerry curls were a popular hairstyle in the 80s and early 90s. They are characterized by tight, spiral curls that are achieved through chemical processing. While they may have fallen out of fashion for a while, jerry curls are making a comeback in 2023. </p><h2>How to Get Jerry Curls</h2><p>Getting jerry curls involves a chemical process, so it's important to take the necessary precautions to protect your hair and scalp. Here's a step by step guide on how to get jerry curls:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose a Relaxer</h3><p>The first step in getting jerry curls is to choose a relaxer. A relaxer is a chemical that will straighten your hair and prepare it for the curling process. There are two types of relaxers: lye and no-lye. Lye relaxers are stronger and can be more damaging to your hair, while no-lye relaxers are gentler but may not be as effective. Choose the relaxer that works best for your hair type.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply the Relaxer</h3><p>Once you have chosen your relaxer, it's time to apply it to your hair. Follow the instructions on the package carefully, as overprocessing your hair can lead to damage. Make sure to wear gloves and protect your skin and scalp from the relaxer. After applying the relaxer, rinse your hair thoroughly with water.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply the Activator</h3><p>After applying the relaxer, it's time to apply the activator. The activator is a chemical that will create the curls in your hair. Apply the activator to your hair, making sure to distribute it evenly. Leave the activator in your hair for the recommended amount of time, then rinse it out thoroughly with water.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Curls</h3><p>Once you have rinsed out the activator, it's time to style your curls. Use a curling gel or mousse to define your curls and give them extra hold. You can also use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to help set your curls. Once your curls are dry, use a pick or wide-tooth comb to style them to your liking.</p><h2>Tips for Getting the Perfect Jerry Curls</h2><ul><li>Don't overprocess your hair with the relaxer. Follow the instructions carefully to avoid damage.</li><li>Use a deep conditioner before and after the curling process to keep your hair healthy.</li><li>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before blow drying or using hot tools.</li><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage while you sleep.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How long do jerry curls last?</h3><p>Jerry curls can last for several weeks to a few months, depending on how well you take care of them. Use a curling gel or mousse to define your curls and help them last longer.</p><h3>Can you get jerry curls on natural hair?</h3><p>While jerry curls are typically achieved through chemical processing, you can also use a curling iron or hot rollers to create similar curls on natural hair.</p><h3>How often should you wash jerry curls?</h3><p>You should wash your jerry curls every 7-10 days to avoid over-drying your hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy.</p><h2>Hair Care for Jerry Curls</h2><p>Once you have jerry curls, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and prevent damage. Here are some tips for caring for your jerry curls:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid over-drying your hair.</li><li>Deep condition your hair once a week to keep it moisturized.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on your hair, as this can cause damage.</li><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage while you sleep.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you can achieve the perfect jerry curls in 2023. Follow this step by step guide and take care of your hair to keep your curls looking healthy and stylish. </p></article>
