This trend has grown in popularity, and it shows no sign of slowing down.</p><p>Celebrities like Zendaya, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Lizzo have been rocking their curls, and the fashion industry has taken notice.

Here's a step-by-step guide to styling curly hair:</p><h3>1. Start with Clean, Conditioned Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner designed for curly hair.
