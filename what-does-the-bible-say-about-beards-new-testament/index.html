For example, in 1 Corinthians 11:14, it says, “Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.”</p><p>Some people interpret this passage as a condemnation of long beards on men. However, it is important to note that the passage specifically mentions hair, not beards.

Some people believe that beards are a sign of masculinity and should be grown and maintained as a way of honoring God. Others believe that beards are irrelevant to spiritual matters and that it is up to each person to decide whether or not to grow one.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to grow a beard or not is a personal one.

Here are a few tips:</p><h3>Keep it clean</h3><p>Just as you would wash your hair, it’s important to keep your beard clean. Use a mild shampoo and conditioner to keep it soft and manageable.</p><h3>Trim it regularly</h3><p>Regularly trimming your beard will keep it looking neat and give it a more polished appearance.</p><h3>Use beard oil</h3><p>Beard oil can help moisturize your beard and prevent it from becoming dry and brittle. Look for a natural, unscented oil to avoid any potential allergic reactions.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Is it a sin to shave my beard?</h3><p>A: No, it is not a sin to shave your beard. The Bible provides guidance on the matter, but ultimately the decision to grow or shave a beard is a personal one.</p><h3>Q: What does the Bible say about mustaches?</h3><p>A: The Bible does not specifically mention mustaches. However, the principles of cleanliness and modesty can be applied to mustaches as well as beards.</p><h3>Q: Can women grow beards?</h3><p>A: Women can grow facial hair, including beards. However, cultural and societal expectations often dictate that women remove facial hair.</p><p>We hope this article has provided some useful information about what the Bible says about beards in the New Testament.
