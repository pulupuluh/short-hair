Here’s what you need to do:</p><h3>1. Start With Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfates can strip your hair of natural oils, leaving it dry and frizzy. Rinse your hair with cool water to seal the cuticles and prevent frizz.</p><h3>2. Apply A Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your damp hair to enhance your curls and add volume. Choose a product that suits your hair type and texture. You can use a curl cream, mousse, gel, or leave-in conditioner.</p><h3>3. Scrunch Your Hair</h3><p>Scrunch your hair with your hands to encourage your curls to form. Don’t use a towel to dry your hair, as it can cause frizz and breakage. Instead, use an old t-shirt or a microfiber towel to gently squeeze out excess water.</p><h3>4. Let Your Hair Air Dry</h3><p>Let your hair air dry naturally. Don’t touch your hair while it’s drying, as this can disrupt your curls and make them frizzy. Avoid using a hairdryer or diffuser, as the heat can damage your hair and cause frizz.</p><h3>5. Fluff Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is completely dry, fluff your hair with your fingers to add volume. Don’t use a brush or a comb, as it can break up your curls and make them less defined.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-By-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide on how to air dry curly hair and get volume:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner.

Clip each section up with a hair clip or a hairband.</p><h3>Step 5: Let Your Hair Air Dry</h3><p>Let your hair air dry naturally.
