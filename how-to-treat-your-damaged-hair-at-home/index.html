Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers can damage your hair over time. Try to limit your use of these tools or use them on a lower heat setting. You can also use a heat protectant spray before using heat styling tools.</p><h3>4. Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help prevent split ends and breakage.
