Here are the basic steps for straightening your hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to help tame frizz and keep your hair healthy. Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly to avoid leaving any product residue.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply heat protectant</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair to prevent damage from the heat of the straightening iron. This step is crucial to protect your hair from heat damage and breakage.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow dry your hair</h3><p>Use a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment to dry your hair until it’s about 80% dry. This will help reduce the amount of time you need to spend straightening your hair with a flat iron.</p><h3>Step 4: Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using hair clips or elastic bands. This will make it easier to work through your hair and ensure that you don’t miss any sections.</p><h3>Step 5: Straighten your hair</h3><p>Starting at the roots, use a flat iron to straighten each section of hair. Use a comb to help guide the flat iron down each section of hair. Make sure to move the flat iron slowly and evenly to ensure that your hair is straightened properly.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with a serum</h3><p>Apply a finishing serum to your hair to add shine and reduce frizz. This will help keep your hair looking sleek and straight throughout the day.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a more detailed step-by-step guide to straightening curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.

This will help reduce the amount of time you need to spend straightening your hair with a flat iron.
