A heart shaped face is characterized by a wider forehead and cheekbones that taper down to a narrow chin. The ideal hairstyle for this face shape is one that balances out the wider forehead and narrows the chin. In this article, we will discuss the best hairstyles for heart shaped faces.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A heart shaped face is wider at the forehead and cheekbones, with a narrow chin. This face shape is also known as the inverted triangle shape. The goal of choosing a hairstyle for this face shape is to balance out the wider forehead and to narrow the chin.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Hairstyle</h2><p>When choosing a hairstyle for a heart shaped face, the goal is to balance out the wider forehead and to narrow the chin. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Bangs</h3><p>One of the best ways to balance out a wider forehead is to get bangs. Bangs that fall just below the eyebrows or are side-swept can help to narrow the forehead and balance out the face shape.</p><h3>2. Layers</h3><p>Layers can help to soften the angles of a heart shaped face and create a more balanced look. Layers that start at the chin and fall below can help to narrow the chin and balance out the face shape.</p><h3>3. Length</h3><p>Longer hairstyles can help to elongate a heart shaped face and create a more balanced look. Hairstyles that fall below the shoulders can help to narrow the chin and balance out the face shape.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step by step guide on how to choose the right hairstyle for a heart shaped face:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>Before you can choose the right hairstyle for your face shape, you need to determine what your face shape is. A heart shaped face is wider at the forehead and cheekbones, with a narrow chin.</p><h3>Step 2: Consider Your Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture can also play a role in choosing the right hairstyle. If you have fine hair, you may want to avoid heavy layers that can make your hair look flat. If you have thick hair, you may want to opt for layers to help thin out your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose a Length</h3><p>Longer hairstyles can help to elongate a heart shaped face and create a more balanced look. Hairstyles that fall below the shoulders can help to narrow the chin and balance out the face shape.</p><h3>Step 4: Consider Bangs</h3><p>Bangs can help to balance out a wider forehead. Bangs that fall just below the eyebrows or are side-swept can help to narrow the forehead and balance out the face shape.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when choosing a hairstyle for a heart shaped face:</p><h3>1. Avoid Center Parts</h3><p>Center parts can make a heart shaped face look wider at the forehead. Instead, opt for a side part to help balance out the face shape.</p><h3>2. Avoid Short Hairstyles</h3><p>Short hairstyles can make a heart shaped face look even wider at the forehead. Instead, opt for longer hairstyles that can help to elongate the face.</p><h3>3. Consider Face-Framing Layers</h3><p>Face-framing layers can help to soften the angles of a heart shaped face and create a more balanced look.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I still wear my hair in a ponytail if I have a heart shaped face?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can still wear your hair in a ponytail if you have a heart shaped face. Just make sure to add some volume at the crown of your head to balance out the wider forehead.</p><h3>Q: Are there any hairstyles I should avoid if I have a heart shaped face?</h3><p>A: Yes, you should avoid short hairstyles and center parts if you have a heart shaped face. Short hairstyles can make the forehead look wider, and center parts can make the face shape look more pronounced.</p><h3>Q: Can I still wear bangs if I have a heart shaped face?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can still wear bangs if you have a heart shaped face. Just make sure to choose bangs that fall just below the eyebrows or are side-swept to help balance out the face shape.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>When choosing a hairstyle for a heart shaped face, it is important to also consider hair care.
