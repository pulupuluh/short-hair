The length of the hair on top can vary, from a few inches to several inches, depending on your preference. The sides and back are usually cut short, with a fade or undercut to create a sharp contrast between the two lengths. This haircut can be styled in a variety of ways, from a slicked-back look to a messy, textured style.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Get the Long on Top Short on Sides Haircut</h2><p>If you're interested in getting the long on top short on sides haircut, the first step is to find a skilled barber or hairstylist who has experience with this type of haircut. You can bring in a photo of the style you like, or ask your stylist for recommendations based on your face shape and hair type.</p><h3>Choosing the Right Length</h3><p>The length of your hair on top will depend on your personal preference, but it's important to choose a length that works well with your face shape and hair type. If you have a round face, for example, you may want to avoid a style that's too long on top, as this can make your face look even rounder. Similarly, if you have thick, curly hair, you may want to keep the length shorter to make it more manageable.</p><h3>Choosing the Right Fade</h3><p>The fade is a key element of the long on top short on sides haircut, and there are several types to choose from, including a low fade, mid fade, and high fade. A low fade starts just above the ears and gradually fades into the hairline, while a high fade starts much higher up on the head. The type of fade you choose will depend on your personal preference and the look you're going for.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to getting the long on top short on sides haircut:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair and towel-drying it.</li><li>Section your hair into two parts, with the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back.</li><li>Use clippers to cut the hair on the sides and back to the desired length, starting with a longer guard and gradually working your way down to a shorter guard.</li><li>Create a fade by blending the longer hair on top with the shorter hair on the sides and back.</li><li>Cut the hair on top to the desired length, using scissors or clippers.</li><li>Style your hair using a pomade or wax, depending on the look you're going for.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Styling and Maintaining Your Haircut</h2><p>Here are some tips for styling and maintaining your long on top short on sides haircut:</p><ul><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li><li>Visit your barber or hairstylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim and touch-up.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products and techniques to find the look that works best for you.</li><li>Consider adding highlights or lowlights to add depth and dimension to your hair.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>What face shape is best for the long on top short on sides haircut?</h3><p>The long on top short on sides haircut can work well with a variety of face shapes, but it's particularly flattering for men with oval or square faces.</p><h3>What hair type is best for the long on top short on sides haircut?</h3><p>The long on top short on sides haircut can work well with a variety of hair types, but it's particularly suited to men with straight or wavy hair.</p><h3>How do I style my hair for a formal occasion?</h3><p>For a formal occasion, you can style your hair slicked back or parted to one side.
