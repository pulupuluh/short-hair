It can leave your hair smooth, shiny, and frizz-free. However, it's important to take care of your hair properly after the treatment to ensure that it stays healthy and beautiful.

Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Avoid washing your hair for at least 48 hours</h3><p>After getting a keratin treatment, your hair needs time to settle and absorb the treatment. Avoid washing your hair for at least 48 hours after the treatment. This will ensure that the keratin is fully absorbed and will help to extend the life of your treatment.</p><h3>2. Use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Once you start washing your hair after the 48-hour period, make sure to use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfates can strip the keratin from your hair, which will reduce the longevity of your treatment. Look for products that are specifically designed for keratin-treated hair.</p><h3>3. Don't tie your hair up</h3><p>Avoid tying your hair up for at least 48 hours after the treatment. This will prevent kinks from forming in your hair and will help to maintain the straightness of the keratin treatment.

Avoid using heat styling tools</h3><p>Try to avoid using heat styling tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, for at least a week after the treatment. Heat can damage the keratin in your hair and reduce the longevity of your treatment. If you must use heat styling tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.</p><h3>5. Use a silk pillowcase</h3><p>Using a silk pillowcase can help to prevent frizz and breakage in your hair. Silk is gentle on hair and won't cause any friction, which can lead to frizz and breakage. It also helps to maintain the straightness of your keratin treatment.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to care for black hair after keratin treatment:</p><h3>Step 1: Wait at least 48 hours before washing your hair</h3><p>Give your hair time to absorb the keratin treatment by avoiding washing your hair for at least 48 hours after the treatment.</p><h3>Step 2: Use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>When you do start washing your hair, make sure to use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner.
