If you notice any unevenness, trim the ends as needed.</p><h3>Step 6: Blend the layers</h3><p>If you have layers in your hair, use your scissors to blend them together. Comb through the hair and hold it between your fingers, snipping off any stray hairs that stick out.</p><h3>Step 7: Finish with styling</h3><p>Once you’ve finished cutting your hair, style it as desired.
