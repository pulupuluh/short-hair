This is a common problem that many people face, and it can be frustrating. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help your hair curl evenly on both sides.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>When trying to curl your hair, you may notice that one side curls perfectly while the other side seems to fall flat. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including damage to the hair, improper styling techniques, or even genetics.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you're wondering how to get your hair to curl on both sides, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you're using the right products. A good curling cream or mousse can help give your hair the hold it needs to curl properly.</p><p>Next, try using a different curling iron or wand. Sometimes, the size or shape of the tool can make a big difference in how your hair curls. Experiment with different sizes and shapes to find what works best for you.</p><p>Another tip is to section your hair properly. Make sure you're dividing your hair evenly and curling each section in the same direction. This will help ensure that your curls are consistent on both sides.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>1. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Use a moisturizing conditioner to help prevent damage and dryness.</p><p>2. Apply a curling cream or mousse to your hair. Make sure to distribute it evenly so that all of your hair is coated.</p><p>3. Section your hair into even pieces. Use clips to keep each section separate.</p><p>4.

Use a heat protectant spray to help protect your hair from damage.</p><p>3. Don't touch your hair too much while it's still warm from curling.
