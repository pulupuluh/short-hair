Coarse hair refers to the texture of the hair strands, while thick hair refers to the density of the hair follicles. In other words, you can have fine hair that's coarse, or thick hair that's fine. </p><h3 id="what-is-coarse-hair"> What is Coarse Hair? </h3><p>Coarse hair is hair that has a rough, wiry texture. It's often associated with African American hair, but people of any ethnicity can have coarse hair. Coarse hair strands are thicker than fine hair strands, and they have a larger diameter. This makes coarse hair more resistant to styling and more prone to frizz. </p><h3 id="what-is-thick-hair"> What is Thick Hair? </h3><p>Thick hair refers to the density of the hair follicles. If you have a lot of hair follicles on your scalp, you have thick hair. Thick hair can be fine, medium, or coarse. Fine thick hair has a lot of hair strands, but each strand is thin. Coarse thick hair has fewer strands, but each strand is thick. </p><h3 id="does-coarse-hair-mean-thick"> Does Coarse Hair Mean Thick? </h3><p>No, coarse hair does not mean thick.
