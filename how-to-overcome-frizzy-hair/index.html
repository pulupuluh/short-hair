This means using the right hair products for your hair type, and avoiding harsh chemicals and heat styling tools as much as possible. Here are some tips to help you care for your hair:</p><ul><li>Choose a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically designed for your hair type (e.g. curly, fine, color-treated).</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils and lead to dryness and frizz.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to add moisture to your hair.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools (such as blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons) as much as possible.

Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to gently detangle your locks.</li><li>Apply a small amount of hair oil or serum to your hair before styling to add shine and tame frizz.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to help distribute heat evenly and prevent frizz.</li><li>Avoid touching your hair too much throughout the day, as this can cause frizz and breakage.</li></ul><h2 id="products">Products to Try</h2><p>There are a variety of hair products on the market that are specifically designed to help tame frizz and create a smooth, sleek look.

However, with proper care and styling techniques, you can minimize frizz and achieve a sleeker look.</p><h3>Q: Is it better to air dry or blow dry frizzy hair?</h3><p>A: It's generally better to air dry frizzy hair, as heat styling tools can cause further damage and frizz.
