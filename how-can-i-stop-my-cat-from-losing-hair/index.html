Make sure your cat is getting a balanced and nutritious diet that is appropriate for their age, breed and health status. Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your cat.</p><h3>2. Reduce Stress</h3><p>Cats are sensitive creatures and can become stressed easily. Stress can cause hair loss, among other health problems. Provide your cat with a calm and secure environment, and avoid sudden changes in routine or environment. Play with your cat regularly, provide toys and scratching posts, and give them plenty of love and attention.</p><h3>3. Address Allergies</h3><p>Allergies can cause your cat to scratch and bite at their skin, leading to hair loss. Common allergens include food, pollen, dust and flea bites.
