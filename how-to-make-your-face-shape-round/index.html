Do you want a rounder and softer look? Well, you're in luck because we have a complete guide on how to make your face shape round. In this article, we will cover everything from how to contour your face to how to style your hair to achieve a rounder look. So, let's dive in!</p><h2> Description </h2><p>Having a rounder face shape is often viewed as more youthful and feminine. It can help soften sharp features and create a more balanced appearance. However, not everyone is born with a naturally round face shape. But thankfully, there are several ways to make your face shape round without undergoing surgery. By using makeup techniques, hair styling tricks, and facial exercises, you can achieve the look you desire.</p><h2> How to Make Your Face Shape Round </h2><h3> Step 1: Contour Your Face </h3><p>The first step in creating a rounder face shape is by contouring. Using a contouring powder or cream that is two shades darker than your skin tone, apply it to the areas you want to recede. This includes your temples, jawline, and the sides of your forehead. Then, using a highlighter, apply it to the areas you want to bring forward. This includes the center of your forehead, the bridge of your nose, and the apples of your cheeks. Blending is key to achieving a natural look.</p><h3> Step 2: Use Blush </h3><p>Adding blush to the apples of your cheeks will help create a rounder look. Use a blush brush to apply a soft pink or peachy shade to the apples of your cheeks. Be sure to blend it out towards your hairline to create a seamless look.</p><h3> Step 3: Style Your Hair </h3><p>Your hair can also play a role in creating a rounder face shape. Avoid hairstyles that accentuate your angular features, such as a middle part or slicked-back ponytail. Instead, opt for soft, layered hairstyles that frame your face. Adding waves or curls can also help create a rounder look.</p><h3> Step 4: Try Facial Exercises </h3><p>Facial exercises can help tone and strengthen the muscles in your face, creating a more defined and rounder look. One exercise you can try is the cheek puff. Simply puff out your cheeks and hold for five seconds, then release. Repeat this exercise for ten reps.</p><h2> Tips </h2><p>- Use a matte contouring powder or cream to avoid a shiny or greasy look.</p><p>- Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks for a natural flush.</p><p>- Experiment with different hairstyles to find what flatters your face shape.</p><p>- Be consistent with your facial exercises for best results.</p><h2> FAQ </h2><p>Q: Can I achieve a rounder face shape without contouring?</p><p>A: Yes, you can also achieve a rounder face shape by using a fuller coverage foundation and applying blush to the apples of your cheeks.</p><p>Q: How often should I do facial exercises?</p><p>A: Aim to do facial exercises at least three times a week for best results.</p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>When styling your hair to create a rounder face shape, it's important to use hair care products that nourish and protect your hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils. A weekly hair mask can also help hydrate and strengthen your hair. Finally, protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before using any hot tools.</p><h2> Conclusion </h2><p>By following these tips and tricks, you can make your face shape round without undergoing surgery. Remember to contour, use blush, style your hair, and try facial exercises for best results. With a little effort and consistency, you can achieve the look you desire.</p></article>
