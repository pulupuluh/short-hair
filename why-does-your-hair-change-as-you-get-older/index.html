As we get older, the hair follicles shrink, and the hair becomes thinner and weaker. The production of melanin, the pigment that gives our hair its color, also decreases. This results in gray or white hair. The oil glands that produce sebum, the natural oil that keeps our hair moisturized, also decrease. This can result in dry, brittle hair that is prone to breakage.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>There is no way to stop the natural aging process of our hair, but there are things we can do to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals can help keep your hair healthy. Foods that are good for your hair include leafy greens, eggs, nuts, and fish.</p><h3>2. Stay Hydrated</h3><p>Drinking plenty of water can help keep your hair hydrated and healthy. Aim for at least eight glasses of water per day.</p><h3>3. Use Gentle Hair Products</h3><p>As we age, our hair becomes more fragile and prone to damage.
