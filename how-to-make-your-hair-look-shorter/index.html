These hairstyles are perfect for those who want to try a shorter look but are not yet ready to commit to a drastic change. A bob or lob can be styled in various ways, such as straight, wavy, or curly.</p><h3>2. Use Hair Extensions</h3><p>Another way to make your hair appear shorter is by using hair extensions.
