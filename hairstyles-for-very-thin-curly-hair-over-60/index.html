This type of hair can be very delicate and prone to breakage, so it's important to choose hairstyles and hair care routines that are gentle and nourishing. Additionally, very thin curly hair over 60 may have a different texture than it did in your younger years, so you'll want to choose hairstyles that work with your current hair type.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Choose the Right Hairstyle</h3><p>When choosing a hairstyle for very thin curly hair over 60, there are a few things to keep in mind.

If you have a square face, you may want to choose a style that softens your features.</p><p>Next, consider your hair texture. Very thin curly hair over 60 may have a looser curl pattern than it did when you were younger, so you'll want to choose a style that works with your current texture. You may also want to consider adding layers to your hair, as this can add volume and movement.</p><p>Finally, think about how much time you want to spend styling your hair each day. If you're looking for a low-maintenance style, you may want to choose a shorter cut that requires minimal styling.
