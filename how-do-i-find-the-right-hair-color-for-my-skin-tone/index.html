If they appear blue or purple, you have cool undertones. If they appear green, you have warm undertones.</li><li>Hold a white piece of paper next to your face. If your skin appears pink or blue, you have cool undertones. If your skin appears yellow or beige, you have warm undertones.</li><li>Try on jewelry. If silver jewelry looks better on you, you have cool undertones. If gold jewelry looks better on you, you have warm undertones.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Once you have determined your skin undertone, you can choose a hair color that complements it:</p><ul><li>If you have cool undertones, choose hair colors with cool undertones such as ash blonde, platinum blonde, cool brown, or black.</li><li>If you have warm undertones, choose hair colors with warm undertones such as golden blonde, honey blonde, warm brown, or auburn.</li><li>If you have neutral undertones, you can choose hair colors with both cool and warm undertones.</li></ul><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when choosing a hair color:</p><ul><li>Consider your natural hair color. If you have dark hair, it may be difficult to achieve a light hair color without damaging your hair. Choose a hair color that is close to your natural hair color for a more natural look.</li><li>Consider your lifestyle. If you have a busy lifestyle, choose a hair color that requires minimal maintenance.</li><li>Consider your skin tone. If you have fair skin, choose a lighter hair color.
