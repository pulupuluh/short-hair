It's important to cut your hair when it's dry, as wet hair can stretch and appear longer than it actually is.</p><h2 id="section2">Section 2: Cutting the Layers</h2><p>Start by parting your hair down the middle and combing it straight. Clip one side of your hair to keep it out of the way.</p><p>Next, take a small section of hair from the top of your head and hold it straight up. This will be the guide for the rest of your layers.

Can I cut my own v-cut layers?</h3><p>While it's possible to cut your own v-cut layers, it's best to have a professional hairstylist do it for you.

How often should I get my v-cut layers trimmed?</h3><p>It's recommended to get your v-cut layers trimmed every 6-8 weeks to keep them looking healthy and fresh.
