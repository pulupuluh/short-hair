You can use synthetic hair, human hair, or a combination of both. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Hair</h3><p>The first step is to choose the type of hair you want to use. Synthetic hair is less expensive and comes in a wide range of colors, but it doesn’t look as natural as human hair. Human hair is more expensive but blends seamlessly with your natural hair. You can also choose a combination of both.</p><h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Before attaching your extensions, you need to prepare your natural hair. Wash and condition your hair to remove any product buildup, then blow-dry it straight. This will ensure that the extensions are attached to clean, dry hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Attach the Extensions</h3><p>Using a crochet hook or a latch hook, attach the extensions to your natural hair. Start at the roots and work your way down, making sure to secure the extensions tightly. Repeat this process until you have attached extensions to your entire head.</p><h3>Step 4: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Once your extensions are attached, you need to section your hair into the size of dreads you want. Use a comb to create even sections and secure each section with a rubber band or hair tie.</p><h3>Step 5: Backcomb Your Hair</h3><p>Starting at the roots, backcomb each section of hair by holding it taut and combing towards the roots. This will create knots and tangles that will eventually form into dreadlocks. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</p><h3>Step 6: Palm Roll Your Hair</h3><p>After backcombing, use your palms to roll each section of hair in a circular motion. This will help to smooth out the knots and tangles and encourage your hair to form into dreadlocks. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed step-by-step guide to starting dreads with added hair:</p><ol><li>Choose your hair.</li><li>Prepare your hair by washing, conditioning, and blow-drying.</li><li>Attach the extensions using a crochet hook or latch hook.</li><li>Section your hair into the size of dreads you want.</li><li>Backcomb each section of hair.</li><li>Palm roll each section of hair.</li><li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 until all sections of hair are backcombed and palm rolled.</li><li>Use a dread wax or gel to help your hair lock together.</li><li>Wrap your hair in a silk scarf overnight to help it set.</li><li>Repeat the palm rolling process every few days until your dreads are established.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Success</h2><p>Starting dreads with added hair can be a time-consuming process, but it’s worth it to achieve the look you want.
