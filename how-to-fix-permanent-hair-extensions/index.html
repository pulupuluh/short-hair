These are extensions that are fixed to your natural hair using a variety of methods, including glue, tape, or beads.</p><p>The key to fixing permanent hair extensions is to ensure that they are attached securely to your natural hair. This will prevent them from slipping or falling out, which can be both frustrating and embarrassing. Here are the basic steps you need to follow:</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Clean and prepare your hair</strong><br/> Before you begin fixing your permanent hair extensions, you need to make sure your natural hair is clean and dry. Shampoo and condition your hair as usual, and let it air dry or blow dry it. Avoid using any styling products that can make your hair greasy or heavy, as this can affect the bonding of the extensions.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Section your hair</strong><br/> Divide your hair into sections using hair clips. This will make it easier to work with and ensure that you don't miss any spots when attaching the extensions.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Attach the extensions</strong><br/> Take a small section of your natural hair and apply a small amount of glue or tape to the root. Attach the extension to the root of your natural hair and press firmly. Repeat this process until all the extensions are attached.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blend the extensions with your natural hair</strong><br/> Use a comb to blend the extensions with your natural hair. This will create a seamless and natural-looking finish.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Style your hair</strong><br/> Once the extensions are attached and blended, you can style your hair as usual. However, avoid using any heat styling tools directly on the bonds, as this can weaken the glue or tape.</p><h3 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Permanent Hair Extensions</h3><p>Now that you know how to fix permanent hair extensions, here are some tips to help you maintain them:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid damaging the bonds</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools directly on the bonds</li><li>Be gentle when brushing or combing your hair to avoid pulling on the extensions</li><li>Sleep with your hair in a loose braid to prevent tangling</li><li>Get regular maintenance appointments with your hairstylist to ensure the extensions are in good condition</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p><strong>Q: How long do permanent hair extensions last?</strong><br/> A: The lifespan of permanent hair extensions depends on several factors, including the method of attachment, the quality of the extensions, and how well you maintain them.
