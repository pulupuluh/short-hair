Sometimes, you just want to tie it up and get it out of your face. But with short hair, it can be difficult to find the right hair accessory to do so. That's where a pencil comes in handy! Here's how to tie up short hair with a pencil.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>First, gather all of your hair at the crown of your head. Then, take a pencil and hold it parallel to your hairline, with the eraser side facing up. Place the pencil under your hair, right at the base of the ponytail, and hold it tightly with your non-dominant hand.</p><p>Next, take your dominant hand and wrap your hair around the pencil. Start at the base of the ponytail and work your way down, making sure to wrap tightly and evenly. Once you've wrapped all of your hair around the pencil, tuck the ends underneath the pencil and secure it in place with bobby pins.</p><p>Adjust the pencil as needed to make sure it's centered and secure. You can also loosen the hair around your face or pull out some strands to create a more casual, effortless look.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather your hair</h3><p>Gather all of your hair at the crown of your head. Use a comb or your fingers to smooth out any bumps or flyaways.</p><h3>Step 2: Place the pencil</h3><p>Hold the pencil parallel to your hairline, with the eraser side facing up. Place the pencil under your hair, right at the base of the ponytail, and hold it tightly with your non-dominant hand.</p><h3>Step 3: Wrap your hair</h3><p>Using your dominant hand, start wrapping your hair around the pencil. Start at the base of the ponytail and work your way down, making sure to wrap tightly and evenly. Continue until all of your hair is wrapped around the pencil.</p><h3>Step 4: Tuck the ends and secure with bobby pins</h3><p>Tuck the ends of your hair under the pencil and secure it in place with bobby pins. Use as many bobby pins as needed to make sure the pencil is secure.</p><h3>Step 5: Adjust and style</h3><p>Adjust the pencil as needed to make sure it's centered and secure. You can also loosen the hair around your face or pull out some strands to create a more casual, effortless look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Use a sharpened pencil for a neater look.</li><li>Try using different colored pencils to match your outfit.</li><li>Add some hairspray or texturizing spray to your hair before tying it up to add some grip and hold.</li><li>Experiment with different wrapping techniques to create different looks.</li><li>If you have really short hair, try using a shorter pencil or a chopstick instead.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Is it bad for your hair to tie it up with a pencil?</h3><p>No, tying up your hair with a pencil is not bad for your hair as long as you do it gently and don't pull too tightly. Make sure to use bobby pins to secure the pencil in place so it doesn't move around too much.</p><h3>Can I use a pen instead of a pencil?</h3><p>While you technically can use a pen instead of a pencil, it's not recommended. Pens are not designed to be used as hair accessories and can cause damage to your hair. Stick with a pencil or other hair accessory specifically designed for tying up hair.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Remember to take care of your hair even when it's tied up. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Avoid tying your hair up too tightly or using hair accessories that can cause damage to your hair. And always be gentle when brushing or combing your hair, especially when it's tied up with a pencil.</p></article>
