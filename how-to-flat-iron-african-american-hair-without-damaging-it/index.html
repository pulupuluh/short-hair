With the wrong technique or heat setting, flat ironing can cause damage, breakage, and even permanent damage to the hair. We've put together a guide to help you flat iron African American hair without damaging it.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Flat Iron African American Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Flat Ironing African American Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Flat Ironed African American Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Flat Iron African American Hair</h2><p>Flat ironing African American hair is different from other hair types, and it requires some special attention to avoid damage. Here are some tips to help you flat iron African American hair without damaging it:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, moisturized hair</h3><p>Before flat ironing African American hair, it's important to start with clean, moisturized hair. Use a gentle shampoo and follow up with a deep conditioner to ensure your hair is properly hydrated. Dry your hair completely before flat ironing to avoid heat damage.</p><h3>2. Use a heat protectant</h3><p>Before using a flat iron, it's essential to use a heat protectant spray or cream. The heat protectant creates a barrier between the flat iron and your hair, reducing the risk of damage. Apply the heat protectant to each section of hair before flat ironing.</p><h3>3. Choose the right flat iron</h3><p>When selecting a flat iron for African American hair, it's essential to choose one with adjustable heat settings. Start with a low heat setting and work your way up until you find the right temperature for your hair. Avoid flat irons with metal plates, as they can cause severe damage to African American hair.</p><h3>4. Section your hair</h3><p>Sectioning your hair makes flat ironing more manageable and ensures each section is thoroughly straightened. Divide your hair into four to six sections, depending on the thickness of your hair, and secure each section with a hair clip.</p><h3>5. Flat iron each section slowly</h3><p>When flat ironing African American hair, it's essential to work slowly and carefully. Start at the roots and slowly glide the flat iron down to the ends of your hair. Avoid going over the same section of hair multiple times, as this can cause damage.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to help you flat iron African American hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and condition your hair</h3><p>Start with clean, moisturized hair.
