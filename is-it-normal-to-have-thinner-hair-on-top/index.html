It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, stress, and aging. Thinning hair on top is often more noticeable and can be a source of insecurity for many people.</p><p>While thinning hair can be a sign of an underlying health condition, it is important to note that it is also a natural part of the aging process. As we age, our hair follicles shrink and produce thinner, weaker hair strands.
