These include:</p><h3>1. Change Your Hairstyle</h3><p>Changing your hairstyle can help to conceal an uneven hairline. You can try a fringe or bangs that will cover the area. You can also try a side-parted hairstyle that will draw attention away from the uneven area.</p><h3>2. Hair Transplant</h3><p>A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves taking hair from one area of your head and transplanting it to the bald or thinning area. This can be an effective solution for an uneven hairline. However, it can be expensive and may require multiple sessions.</p><h3>3. Hairline Lowering Surgery</h3><p>Hairline lowering surgery is a procedure that involves moving the hairline forward to create a more even appearance. This procedure is also known as a scalp advancement.
