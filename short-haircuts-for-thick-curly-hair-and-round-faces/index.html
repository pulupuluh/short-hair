First, you want to make sure the haircut complements your face shape. Second, you want to find a style that works with your natural texture. Here are a few tips to help you choose the right haircut:</p><ul><li>Look for hairstyles that feature layers. Layers can help to add volume to your hair and create a more flattering shape for your face.</li><li>Avoid haircuts that are too short.
