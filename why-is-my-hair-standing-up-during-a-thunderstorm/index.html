You might have wondered what is happening to your hair, and if it is something to be worried about. In this article, we will explain why your hair stands up during a thunderstorm and provide tips on how to stay safe.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>During a thunderstorm, you may feel a tingling sensation on your skin or see your hair standing up. This happens because of the buildup of static electricity in the air. Thunderstorms are often accompanied by lightning strikes, which create an electrical field around them. This electrical field can cause electrical charges to accumulate on the ground and on objects on the ground, including your hair.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you are outside during a thunderstorm and feel your hair standing up, take immediate action to protect yourself. The buildup of static electricity in the air can create a dangerous situation if not handled correctly. Here are some steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Get indoors</h3><p>Find a safe place to shelter immediately. Stay away from trees, metal objects, and water. If you are outside and cannot find shelter, try to find a low-lying area and crouch down with your feet together. Avoid lying down on the ground.</p><h3>Step 2: Wait it out</h3><p>Wait until the thunderstorm passes before going back outside. Lightning can strike up to 10 miles away from the storm, so wait at least 30 minutes after the last thunderclap before venturing outside.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to stay safe during a thunderstorm:</p><ul><li>Avoid using electronic devices and water during a thunderstorm</li><li>Stay away from windows and doors</li><li>Do not use a landline phone during a thunderstorm</li><li>Stay away from tall objects, such as trees and poles</li><li>Avoid swimming and boating during a thunderstorm</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What causes my hair to stand up during a thunderstorm?</h3><p>The buildup of static electricity in the air during a thunderstorm can cause your hair to stand up.
