It absorbs excess oil and adds volume to your hair. Spray dry shampoo on your roots, and massage it in with your fingertips. You can also use baby powder as an alternative.</p><h3>Add a Pop of Color</h3><p>Adding highlights or lowlights to your hair can create the illusion of thicker hair. The color adds depth and dimension to your hair, making it look fuller. Consult with your hairstylist to find the right shade for your hair.</p><h3>Use Hair Extensions</h3><p>Hair extensions are an excellent option if you want to add volume and length to your hair.
