Choosing the right frame is as important as choosing the right hairstyle. It can enhance your facial features and make you look more attractive. But, how do you figure out what is my face shape glasses? In this article, we will explore the different face shapes and how to choose the best glasses for your face. </p><h2> What is My Face Shape? </h2><p>Before we talk about glasses, it is essential to determine your face shape. There are six basic face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and triangle. To find out your face shape, you need to measure your forehead, cheekbones, jawline, and face length. </p><h3> How to Measure Your Face? </h3><p>Here are the steps to measure your face: </p><ol><li> Forehead: Measure the widest part of your forehead with a tape measure. </li><li> Cheekbones: Measure the widest part of your cheekbones, just below your eyes. </li><li> Jawline: Measure from the tip of your chin to the bottom of your earlobe. </li><li> Face Length: Measure from the center of your hairline to the tip of your chin. </li></ol><p>Once you have measured your face, compare the measurements to determine your face shape. </p><h2> What Glasses Suit My Face Shape? </h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, it's time to choose the right glasses. Here are some tips: </p><h3> Oval Face Shape </h3><p>If you have an oval face shape, you're in luck! Almost any style of glasses will suit you. However, try to avoid frames that are too big or too small for your face. </p><h3> Round Face Shape </h3><p>If you have a round face shape, choose glasses that are angular or rectangular. This will help to elongate your face and make it look slimmer. Avoid round frames as they will only accentuate the roundness of your face. </p><h3> Square Face Shape </h3><p>If you have a square face shape, choose glasses that are round or oval. This will help to soften the angles of your face. Avoid square frames as they will only make your face look boxy. </p><h3> Heart Face Shape </h3><p>If you have a heart face shape, choose glasses that are wider at the bottom than the top. This will balance out the width of your forehead and narrow chin. Avoid glasses that are too narrow as they will make your forehead look wider. </p><h3> Diamond Face Shape </h3><p>If you have a diamond face shape, choose glasses that are wider than your cheekbones.
