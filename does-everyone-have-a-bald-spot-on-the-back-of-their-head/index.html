Try to wear your hair down or in loose styles to avoid this. </p><h3>2. Protect Your Hair from Heat</h3><p>Heat styling tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, can damage your hair and lead to breakage and thinning. If you must use heat tools, use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature low. </p><h3>3.
