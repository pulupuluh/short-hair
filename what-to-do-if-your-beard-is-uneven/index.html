This is because some areas of your beard might be growing slower than others. Give your beard time to grow, and it might fill in the bald patches.</p><h3>2. Trim It Down</h3><p>If some parts of your beard are growing faster than others, you can trim it down to even out the length. Use a good quality trimmer, and take your time to achieve the desired length. Be careful not to trim too much, as this can cause further unevenness.</p><h3>3.
