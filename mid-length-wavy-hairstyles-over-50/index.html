In this guide, we'll share some tips and tricks for finding the perfect mid length wavy hairstyle for your face shape and lifestyle.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Mid length wavy hairstyles are haircuts that fall between the chin and shoulders and feature natural-looking waves or curls. This length is perfect for women over 50 who want a low-maintenance yet stylish haircut that looks great with minimal effort. Mid length wavy hairstyles can also work on any hair type, from thin and fine to thick and curly.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>The first step in getting a mid length wavy hairstyle is to find a reputable hairstylist who has experience working with mature women. Bring in photos of hairstyles that you like and discuss your lifestyle and hair type with your stylist. They'll be able to recommend a haircut that flatters your face shape and works well with your natural hair texture.</p><p>Once you've settled on a haircut, you'll need to learn how to style it at home. Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and texture. Towel-dry your hair and apply a styling cream or mousse to enhance your natural waves or curls. Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair on low heat, scrunching your hair as you go to encourage your waves or curls to form.</p><h2>Step By Step</h2><p><b>Step 1:</b> Find a reputable hairstylist who has experience working with mature women.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Bring in photos of hairstyles that you like and discuss your lifestyle and hair type with your stylist.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> Once you've settled on a haircut, learn how to style it at home.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and texture.</p><p><b>Step 5:</b> Towel-dry your hair and apply a styling cream or mousse to enhance your natural waves or curls.</p><p><b>Step 6:</b> Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair on low heat, scrunching your hair as you go to encourage your waves or curls to form.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips for getting the most out of your mid length wavy hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Invest in a quality hair dryer with a diffuser attachment.</li><li>Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and texture to your hair.</li><li>Apply a styling cream or mousse to enhance your natural waves or curls.</li><li>Scrunch your hair as you dry it to encourage your waves or curls to form.</li><li>Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair when it's wet.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to keep it looking healthy and fresh.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p><b>Q: Will a mid length wavy hairstyle make me look older?</b></p><p>A: No, a mid length wavy hairstyle can actually make you look younger and more vibrant.
