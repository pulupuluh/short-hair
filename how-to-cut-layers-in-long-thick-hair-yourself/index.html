Make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin cutting.</li><li>Section off your hair. Use clips to section off your hair into manageable sections. Start by parting your hair down the middle and then divide it into two sections, one on each side of your head.</li><li>Decide on the length of your layers. Determine how long you want your layers to be. For subtle layers, choose a length that is only slightly shorter than your overall hair length. For more dramatic layers, choose a length that is several inches shorter than your overall hair length.</li><li>Start cutting. Take a small section of hair from the bottom of the first section and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut at an angle. Cut the hair at the length you decided on in step 3. Continue cutting small sections of hair at an angle until you have cut all the hair in that section. Repeat on the other side.</li><li>Move up to the next section. Unclip the next section of hair and repeat the same process. Make sure the layers are even on both sides of your head.</li><li>Continue cutting the rest of your hair. Work your way up your head, cutting each section of hair at the length you decided on.</li><li>Blend the layers. Once you have cut all the sections of hair, blend the layers together by taking small sections of hair and cutting them at a slight angle. This will create a softer, more natural look.</li><li>Check for any uneven spots. Take a look at your hair in the mirror and make sure the layers are even on both sides of your head. If you notice any uneven spots, make small adjustments with your scissors.</li><li>Style your hair. Once you are happy with the length and shape of your layers, style your hair as desired.</li><li>Clean up. Clean up any loose hair on the floor or counter and sanitize your scissors before putting them away.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Layers in Long Thick Hair Yourself:</h3><ul><li>Start with small sections of hair.
