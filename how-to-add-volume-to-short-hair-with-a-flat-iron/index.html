Look for a flat iron with ceramic or tourmaline plates, which will help to distribute heat evenly and reduce damage to your hair. Here's how to add volume to short hair with a flat iron:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly before you begin. If your hair is damp, it won't hold a curl or wave as well.</p><h3>2. Apply heat protectant</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair to minimize damage from the flat iron's heat.</p><h3>3. Section your hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small sections, starting at the bottom and working your way up.</p><h3>4. Clamp the flat iron at the roots</h3><p>Take a small section of hair and clamp the flat iron at the roots. Hold the flat iron in this position for a few seconds to create volume at the roots.</p><h3>5. Twist the flat iron</h3><p>Twist the flat iron away from your face, making sure to keep the hair taut. Hold the flat iron in this position for a few seconds to create a loose wave.</p><h3>6. Repeat on all sections</h3><p>Repeat steps 4 and 5 on all sections of your hair, working your way up from the bottom. Make sure to alternate the direction of the twist for a more natural look.</p><h3>7. Shake out your hair</h3><p>Once you've curled all of your hair, shake your head to loosen the curls and create more volume.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step by step guide on how to add volume to short hair with a flat iron:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly before you begin.
