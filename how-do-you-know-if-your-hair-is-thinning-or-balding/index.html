Hair thinning is the gradual reduction in the thickness of individual hair strands, while balding is a more significant loss of hair, resulting in visible patches of baldness. Hair thinning can occur in both men and women, while balding is more common in men.</p><h3>Causes of Hair Thinning and Balding</h3><p>There are many factors that can cause hair thinning and balding, including genetics, aging, hormonal changes, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors. Some of the most common causes include:</p><ul><li>Androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness)</li><li>Traction alopecia (hair loss due to tight hairstyles)</li><li>Alopecia areata (autoimmune disorder)</li><li>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy</li><li>Stress and anxiety</li><li>Poor nutrition and vitamin deficiencies</li><li>Smoking and alcohol consumption</li></ul><h3>Symptoms of Hair Thinning and Balding</h3><p>The symptoms of hair thinning and balding can vary depending on the underlying cause.
