Let's take a closer look at each of these methods.</p><h3>Volumizing Products</h3><p>Volumizing products, such as mousse, root lifter, and volumizing spray, can help add volume to your hair. Apply these products to your roots and work your way down to the ends. Be sure not to apply too much product, as this can weigh your hair down.</p><h3>Blow Drying Upside Down</h3><p>Blow drying your hair upside down can help add volume to the roots. Flip your hair over and blow dry it while using a round brush to lift the hair at the roots. You can also use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to help add volume to your curls.</p><h3>Teasing Your Hair</h3><p>Teasing your hair can help add volume and texture. Use a teasing comb or brush to lightly backcomb your hair at the roots. Be sure not to tease too aggressively, as this can damage your hair.</p><h3>Using Hot Rollers</h3><p>Hot rollers can help add volume and curl to your hair. Roll your hair in sections and let the rollers cool completely before removing them. Gently brush out your curls with a wide-tooth comb for a soft, voluminous look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step By Step: Adding Volume to Flat Hair</h2><p>Now that you know the different methods for adding volume to flat hair, let's break it down into a step-by-step process.</p><h3>Step 1: Start With Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to help add volume to your hair.
