This will create a diagonal line that falls away from the face. Repeat on the other side.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Back</h3><p>Work on the back section of your hair. Comb the hair straight down and cut it in a straight line. The length of the hair should be the same as the sides. </p><h3>Step 5: Check for Balance</h3><p>After cutting all the sections, check for balance.
