Simply take a small section of hair and comb it towards the scalp. Repeat this process until you've achieved the desired volume.</p><h3>2. Blow Drying</h3><p>Blow drying your hair upside down can add volume and lift at the roots. Use a round brush to lift the hair and direct the heat towards the roots.</p><h3>3.
