Infections</h3><p>Infections can also cause hair loss on your cat's ears. Bacterial or fungal infections can develop on the skin, leading to hair loss, redness, and inflammation. Your vet can diagnose and treat any infections your cat may have.</p><h3>4. Trauma</h3><p>If your cat has been in a fight or experienced some other trauma, it can cause hair loss on their ears.
