A rectangle face shape is characterized by a longer face shape with a square jawline, and a haircut that adds width and volume can help balance out your face shape. In this guide, we'll take a look at the best haircuts for rectangle face shapes, how to achieve them, and hair care tips to keep your hair looking healthy and vibrant.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</a></li><li><a href="#best-haircuts">Best Haircuts for Rectangle Face Shapes</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Your Best Haircut</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Haircut</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips for a Healthy Look</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>Before we dive into the best haircuts for rectangle face shapes, it's important to determine your face shape. To do this, pull your hair back away from your face and take a close-up photo of yourself. Then, use a ruler to measure the length and width of your face, as well as the angles of your jawline and forehead. If your face is longer than it is wide, with a square jawline and a broad forehead, then you have a rectangle face shape.</p><h2 id="best-haircuts">Best Haircuts for Rectangle Face Shapes</h2><p>The key to finding the best haircut for a rectangle face shape is to add volume and width to the sides of your face. This can be achieved with layers, bangs, or shorter haircuts that create the illusion of width. Here are some of the best haircuts for rectangle face shapes:</p><h3>Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers are a great choice for rectangle face shapes because they add movement and volume to your hair. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for long, face-framing layers that start at your cheekbones and cascade down to the ends of your hair. This will help create the illusion of width and balance out your face shape.</p><h3>Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are another great option for rectangle face shapes. They help soften your features and add volume to the sides of your face. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for long, side-swept bangs that start at your temples and blend seamlessly into the rest of your hair.</p><h3>Bob Haircut</h3><p>A bob haircut is a classic choice for rectangle face shapes. A chin-length bob can help add width to your face and balance out your features. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for a blunt bob that falls just above your chin.</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a bold choice for rectangle face shapes, but it can be a great way to add volume and width to your hair. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for a short, choppy pixie cut with lots of layers and texture.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Your Best Haircut</h2><p>Now that you've chosen the best haircut for your rectangle face shape, it's important to know how to achieve it.
