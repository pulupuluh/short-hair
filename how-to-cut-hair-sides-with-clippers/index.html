If you're looking to save money and give yourself a haircut, you might find it challenging to cut the sides of your hair with clippers. In this article, we'll show you how to cut hair sides with clippers in a relaxed English language. </p><h2> Description </h2><p> Cutting hair sides with clippers can be a bit tricky, especially if you're doing it for the first time. However, with the right tools and techniques, it is possible to achieve a great haircut at home. In this step-by-step guide, we'll take you through the process of cutting hair sides with clippers, so you can achieve the look you want. </p><h2> How to Cut Hair Sides with Clippers </h2><h3> Step 1: Choose the Right Clippers </h3><p> The first step to cutting hair sides with clippers is choosing the right tool. You'll need a good set of clippers with different guard sizes. Most hair clippers come with a set of guards that range from 1/16 inch to 1 inch. Choose the guard size based on the length you want for your hair. </p><h3> Step 2: Wash and Dry Your Hair </h3><p> Before you start cutting your hair, make sure it's clean and dry. Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner and let it dry completely. This will help you see the natural texture and shape of your hair, making it easier to cut. </p><h3> Step 3: Section Your Hair </h3><p> Once your hair is dry, section it into two parts: the top and the sides. Use hair clips to secure the top section, so it doesn't interfere with the sides. </p><h3> Step 4: Attach the Guard </h3><p> Attach the guard to your clippers and turn them on. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one if needed. </p><h3> Step 5: Start Cutting </h3><p> Start at the bottom of your hairline and move upwards. Use long, smooth strokes to avoid creating lines or unevenness. Keep the clippers level and flat against your head to ensure an even cut. </p><h3> Step 6: Blend the Sides </h3><p> Once you've cut the sides, remove the guard and blend the hair between the sides and the top using a comb and scissors. Comb the hair upward and use the scissors to cut the hair at an angle. </p><h3> Step 7: Clean Up </h3><p> Use a handheld mirror to check the back of your head, and make any necessary adjustments. Clean up any stray hairs around your ears and neckline using a trimmer or scissors. </p><h2> Tips </h2><p> Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results when cutting hair sides with clippers: </p><ul><li> Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one if needed. </li><li> Use a handheld mirror to check the back of your head. </li><li> Use a comb and scissors to blend the hair between the sides and the top. </li><li> Use smooth, even strokes to avoid creating lines or unevenness. </li><li> Don't rush the process â take your time to ensure an even cut. </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><p> Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting hair sides with clippers: </p><h3> Can I cut my own hair sides with clippers? </h3><p> Yes, you can cut your own hair sides with clippers. However, it's important to take your time, use the right tools, and follow the right techniques to achieve the best results. </p><h3> What guard size should I use for my hair? </h3><p> The guard size you should use depends on the length you want for your hair. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one if needed. </p><h3> How often should I cut my hair sides? </h3><p> How often you should cut your hair sides depends on how fast your hair grows and the length you want to maintain. As a general rule, it's recommended to cut your hair every 4 to 6 weeks. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> Cutting your hair with clippers can be a great way to maintain your hair at home. However, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and shiny. Here are some tips to help you care for your hair: </p><ul><li> Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. </li><li> Use a deep conditioner once a week to help restore moisture. </li><li> Avoid using heat styling tools frequently. </li><li> Get regular trims to prevent split ends. </li><li> Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote hair growth. </li></ul><p> Cutting hair sides with clippers can be a great way to save money and maintain your hair at home.
