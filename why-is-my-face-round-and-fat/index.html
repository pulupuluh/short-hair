This happens when your body retains excess fluids, which can cause puffiness and swelling in your face.</li><li><strong>Aging:</strong> As we age, our skin loses elasticity, and our facial muscles weaken. This can result in a rounder and fuller face.</li></ul><h2>How to Reduce a Round and Fat Face</h2><p>If you're looking to reduce the roundness and fatness of your face, there are several things you can do:</p><ul><li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise can help you lose weight, which can lead to a reduction in facial fat.</li><li><strong>Diet:</strong> Eating a healthy and balanced diet can also help you lose weight and reduce facial fat.
