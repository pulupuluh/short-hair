This hair type lacks volume, can be easily weighed down, and tends to frizz up in humid conditions. To style your hair, you need to use lightweight products that add volume, define curls and combat frizz.</p><p>The first step in styling fine thin frizzy hair is to wash and condition your hair with products that are specifically designed for your hair type. Look for products that are labeled "volumizing" or "curl defining" and avoid anything that contains sulfates or alcohol.</p><h3>Step by Step Guide</h3><p>Here is a step by step guide on how to style fine thin frizzy hair:</p><ol><li>Start by towel-drying your hair to remove excess water.</li><li>Apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner or a curl-defining cream to your hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to distribute the product evenly.</li><li>Flip your hair upside down and blow-dry it using a diffuser attachment. This will help add volume to your roots and define your curls.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron to add more definition to your curls. Wrap small sections of hair around the barrel and hold for a few seconds before releasing.</li><li>Finish off your style with a lightweight hair spray to hold your curls in place without weighing them down.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips for Styling Fine Thin Frizzy Hair</h3><p>Here are some additional tips that can help you style your fine thin frizzy hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it is dry as this can cause breakage and frizz.
