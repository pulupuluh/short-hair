Simply gather your hair at the top of your head and secure it with an elastic band. Then, place your headband over your head and push it down to your forehead.</p><h3>4. Wear it with a Twist-Out</h3><p>If you have a twist-out or braid-out, you can still wear a headband. Simply place the headband over your hairline and push it down to your forehead.
