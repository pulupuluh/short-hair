It can add volume, texture, and definition to your hair, making it a great option for those who want to try something new. But before you take the plunge, you may be wondering how you will look with short curly hair. In this article, we will explore this question and provide you with tips on how to rock this style.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short curly hair can come in many shapes and sizes. It can be a tight coil, a loose wave, or anything in between. This style is perfect for those who want to add some texture and volume to their hair, but don't want to commit to long-term treatments like perms or relaxers.

Choose the right length</h3><p>Short curly hair can come in a variety of lengths, from a pixie cut to a bob. Choose a length that works well with your face shape and hair texture. If you have thick hair, a shorter length may be better to prevent your hair from looking too bulky.</p><h3>3. Embrace the texture</h3><p>One of the best things about short curly hair is the texture it adds to your hair. Don't be afraid to embrace this texture and let your curls do their thing.
