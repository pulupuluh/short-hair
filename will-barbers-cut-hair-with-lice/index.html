You may also wonder if barbers will refuse to cut your hair if you have lice.</p><h2>How to Deal with Lice</h2><p>If you have lice, there are several things you can do to deal with them. The first step is to get rid of the lice and their eggs, also known as nits. You can use over-the-counter lice treatments, such as shampoos and lotions, to kill the lice and nits. You can also use a special comb to remove the nits from your hair. It is essential to follow the instructions carefully and repeat the treatment if necessary.</p><p>You should also wash all your clothes, bedding, and towels in hot water to kill any lice or nits. You should vacuum your home and car to remove any lice or nits that may have fallen off your head. You should also avoid sharing combs, brushes, hats, and other personal items with others.</p><h2>Will Barbers Cut Hair with Lice?</h2><p>The answer to this question is not straightforward. Some barbers may refuse to cut your hair if you have lice because they do not want to risk infesting their tools or spreading the lice to other customers.

This will give the barber the opportunity to decide whether to cut your hair or not. If the barber agrees to cut your hair, they may take some precautions to minimize the risk of spreading the lice.
