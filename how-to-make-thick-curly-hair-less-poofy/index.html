Curly hair tends to be dryer than straight hair, so it's important to use moisturizing products and avoid heat styling whenever possible. Here are some steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Look for products that are specifically designed for curly hair and contain ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, and glycerin. These ingredients will help hydrate your hair and keep it from becoming too dry and frizzy.</p><h3>2. Apply a leave-in conditioner</h3><p>After washing your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner to help lock in moisture. This will help prevent your hair from becoming too dry and frizzy.</p><h3>3. Avoid heat styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair and cause it to become even more poofy. If you must use heat, use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature low.</p><h3>4. Use a diffuser</h3><p>A diffuser attachment for your hair dryer can help distribute heat more evenly and prevent your curls from becoming too poofy. Use a low heat setting and gently scrunch your hair with the diffuser.</p><h3>5. Embrace the frizz</h3><p>Finally, remember that some frizz is inevitable with curly hair. Don't stress too much about it – a little bit of frizz can actually add to the overall look of your curls.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide for making your thick curly hair less poofy:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner to damp hair.</li><li>Avoid heat styling whenever possible.

Experiment to find a washing schedule that works for you.</p><h3>Can I use oil to manage poofy hair?</h3><p>Yes, oil can be a great way to hydrate your hair and prevent frizz.
