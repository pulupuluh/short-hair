Do you want to know what was the clothes style in the 60's? Look no further! In this article, we will take a trip down memory lane and explore the fashion trends that dominated the 60's. From mini skirts to bell-bottoms, we'll cover it all. </p><h2> Description </h2><p> The 60's were a time of change and revolution in many aspects of society, and fashion was no exception. The clothes style in the 60's was a departure from the conservative and structured garments of the 50's. The fashion of this era was characterized by bold colors, patterns, and a sense of freedom and experimentation. </p><h2> How to </h2><p> If you're looking to incorporate some 60's fashion into your wardrobe, there are a few key pieces you can look for. Mini skirts, shift dresses, and high-waisted pants were all popular during this time. Bold prints, such as paisley and floral, were also commonly seen. Accessorize with oversized sunglasses, chunky jewelry, and platform shoes to complete the look. </p><h2> Step by Step </h2><p> Step 1: Start by looking for pieces with bright colors and bold patterns. </p><p> Step 2: Look for mini skirts, shift dresses, and high-waisted pants. </p><p> Step 3: Accessorize with oversized sunglasses, chunky jewelry, and platform shoes. </p><h2> Tips </h2><p> When creating a 60's-inspired outfit, remember to keep it fun and playful. Don't be afraid to mix and match patterns or experiment with different colors. </p><p> Another tip is to focus on the details. A statement piece of jewelry or a bold accessory can really make an outfit pop. </p><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Q: What materials were commonly used in 60's fashion? </h3><p> A: Natural fibers such as cotton, wool, and silk were commonly used in 60's fashion. Synthetic fabrics such as polyester also became popular during this time. </p><h3> Q: Were pants popular for women in the 60's? </h3><p> A: Yes, high-waisted pants were a popular fashion choice for women in the 60's. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> No 60's-inspired outfit is complete without the right hairdo. For women, a popular hairstyle during this time was the beehive. This style involved teasing the hair at the crown of the head and pinning it into a high, voluminous shape. Another popular hairstyle was the bouffant, which also involved teasing the hair for added height. </p><p> For men, the 60's saw the rise of longer hair. The Beatles, in particular, popularized the "mop top" hairstyle, which involved growing the hair out and combing it forward. </p><h2> Conclusion </h2><p> The clothes style in the 60's was a reflection of the cultural changes and sense of liberation that defined the era. If you're looking to add some vintage flair to your wardrobe, try incorporating some of these trends into your outfits. Remember to have fun and experiment with different patterns and accessories to truly capture the spirit of the 60's. </p></article>
