One of the most popular myths is that picking your hair can make it curly. But is that really true? In this article, we'll explore the truth behind this myth and give you some tips on how to achieve curly hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The myth that picking your hair can make it curly has been around for many years. This myth suggests that by picking your hair, you can create small curls or waves in your hair. Some people even believe that picking your hair regularly can permanently change the texture of your hair, making it curly. However, this myth is not entirely true. </p><h2>How to</h2><p>Picking your hair alone cannot make it curly. However, there are some techniques you can use to achieve curly hair. Here are some methods you can try:</p><h3>Method 1: Use Curling Products</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to achieve curly hair is by using curling products. You can use curling creams, gels, or mousses to create curls in your hair. Simply apply the product to your hair, scrunch your hair, and let it air dry. You can also use a diffuser attachment on your hairdryer to enhance the curls.</p><h3>Method 2: Use Heat Styling Tools</h3><p>You can also use heat styling tools like curling irons or wands to create curls in your hair. Make sure to use a heat protectant spray before using any heat styling tools to protect your hair from heat damage.</p><h3>Method 3: Try a Perm</h3><p>If you want a more permanent solution for curly hair, you can try getting a perm. A perm is a chemical treatment that changes the texture of your hair, making it curly or wavy. However, perms can be damaging to your hair, so make sure to consult with a professional stylist before getting a perm.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some step-by-step instructions for achieving curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair.

Can picking your hair make it curly?</h3><p>No, picking your hair alone cannot make it curly. However, there are other methods you can use to achieve curly hair.</p><h3>2.
