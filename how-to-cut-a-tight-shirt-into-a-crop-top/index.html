Make sure it's a shirt that you don't mind cutting up, and that it fits snugly around your torso.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on the length</h3><p>Next, decide on how long you want your crop top to be. Use your ruler or measuring tape to measure from the bottom of your shirt up to your desired length. Mark it with your marking tool.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the shirt</h3><p>Using your scissors, cut along the line that you marked in step 2. Make sure you cut in a straight line to ensure that your crop top is even on both sides.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish the edges</h3><p>Now it's time to finish the edges of your crop top. You can either leave them raw or hem them. If you choose to hem them, fold the edge over twice and sew it in place.</p><h3>Step 5: Try it on</h3><p>Put your new crop top on and see how it fits. If it's too tight or too loose, you can always make adjustments by cutting or hemming it further.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting a tight shirt into a crop top:</p><ul><li>Make sure your scissors are sharp to ensure a clean cut.</li><li>Don't cut too short - you can always cut more off later.</li><li>If you want a distressed look, use sandpaper to fray the edges.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I cut any shirt into a crop top?</h3><p>A: It's best to use a tight shirt for this DIY project.
