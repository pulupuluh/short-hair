For example, a bob may look great on someone with a heart-shaped face, while a pixie cut may be better suited for someone with an oval face.</li><li>Your hair texture: If you have thin or fine hair, you may want to avoid styles that require a lot of volume or texture.

Do you prefer low-maintenance hairstyles? Consider how much time and effort you're willing to put into styling your hair each day.</li></ul><p>Some of the best short hair styles for over 60s include:</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut is a classic short hairstyle that never goes out of style. It's low-maintenance, easy to style, and can be customized to suit your face shape and hair texture. This style is perfect for women who want a chic, modern look.</p><h3>Bob</h3><p>The bob is another timeless short hairstyle that can be adapted to suit any face shape and hair texture. Whether you opt for a classic chin-length bob or a longer, angled bob, this style is versatile and flattering.</p><h3>Layered</h3><p>A layered short hair style can add volume and texture to thin or fine hair, while enhancing the natural texture of thick or curly hair.
