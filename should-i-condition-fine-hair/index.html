How often should I condition fine hair?</h3><p>It's generally recommended to condition fine hair every time you wash it, which is typically every 2-3 days. However, if your hair is particularly dry or damaged, you may want to condition it more frequently.</p><h3>2. Can I use a deep conditioner on fine hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can use a deep conditioner on fine hair, but it's important to choose a lightweight formula that won't weigh your hair down. Look for products that are specifically formulated for fine hair and use them sparingly.</p><h3>3. Should I avoid using conditioner on my roots?</h3><p>Yes, it's generally best to avoid using conditioner on your roots, as this can weigh your hair down and make it look greasy.
