Cross the right section over the middle section, then cross the left section over the middle section. Continue braiding until you reach the end of your hair, then secure with a hair tie.</p><h3>Bun</h3><p>To do a bun, gather your hair at the back of your head and twist it into a coil. Then, wrap the coil around itself to form a bun shape. Secure with bobby pins or a hair tie. For a messy bun, pull out a few strands of hair to frame your face.</p><h3>Half-Up, Half-Down</h3><p>To do a half-up, half-down style, gather the top section of your hair and secure it with a hair tie. You can position the ponytail high or low, depending on your preference. For a sleek look, use a comb to smooth down any flyaways.
