This is because curly hair tends to add volume and width to your hair, which can make your face appear more prominent. However, this is not necessarily true for everyone.</p><p>Several factors determine whether or not your curls make your face look fatter, including your face shape, hair texture, and the way you style your hair. With the right techniques and products, you can enhance your curls and highlight your best features without making your face look bigger.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>There are several ways to style your curls to flatter your face shape and avoid making your face look fatter. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h3>1. Choose the right haircut</h3><p>The right haircut can make a big difference in how your curls frame your face. If you have a round face, consider a layered haircut with longer layers around the face to elongate your features. If you have a square face, opt for shorter layers to soften your jawline.</p><h3>2. Use the right products</h3><p>Choosing the right products for your curls can help you achieve the right balance of volume and definition. Look for products that add moisture and control frizz without weighing down your curls. Avoid heavy oils and creams that can make your hair look flat and greasy.</p><h3>3. Avoid excessive volume</h3><p>While volume is essential for achieving bouncy, healthy-looking curls, too much volume can make your face look fuller. Avoid backcombing or teasing your hair, as this can add unnecessary bulk to your hair. Instead, focus on adding volume at the roots and letting your curls fall naturally.</p><h3>4. Experiment with different styles</h3><p>There are many ways to style curly hair, so don't be afraid to try different looks and see what works best for you. Experiment with updos, braids, and half-up styles to find the right balance of volume and definition for your face shape.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>To achieve the perfect curly hairstyle for your face shape, try this step-by-step guide:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, damp hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, then detangle with a wide-tooth comb or brush. Towel-dry your hair, then apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to your hair.</p><h3>2. Define your curls</h3><p>Use a curl-defining product to enhance your natural curl pattern. Apply the product to your hair in sections, scrunching your hair upward as you go. Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair.</p><h3>3. Add volume at the roots</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a volumizing product to add lift at the roots. Apply the product to your roots and use your fingertips to massage your scalp gently. Flip your head upside down and shake your hair to add volume.</p><h3>4. Style your hair</h3><p>Experiment with different styles, such as a half-up style, a messy bun, or a braid. Use bobby pins or hair ties to secure your hair in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you style your curly hair:</p><ul><li>Don't over-brush your hair, as this can create frizz and make your hair look flat.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too frequently, as this can damage your hair and make it look dull.</li><li>Consider getting regular trims to keep your curls healthy and prevent split ends.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Does curly hair make your face look fatter?</h3><p>Curly hair can add volume and width to your hair, which can make your face look fuller.
