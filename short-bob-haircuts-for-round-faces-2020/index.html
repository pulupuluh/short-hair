You can also use a texturizing spray or pomade to add definition to your layers.</li><li>Finish with a flexible hold hairspray to keep your hair in place throughout the day.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Short Bob Haircut</h2><p>Here are a few tips to help you maintain your short bob haircut:</p><ul><li>Visit your stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim to keep your bob looking fresh and healthy.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too frequently, as this can damage your hair and cause split ends.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and nourished.</li><li>Avoid using heavy styling products that can weigh your hair down and make it look flat.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>1.
