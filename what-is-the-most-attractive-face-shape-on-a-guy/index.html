However, it's important to note that beauty is subjective and what one person finds attractive may not be the same for someone else.</p><p>To determine your face shape, you can use a simple method that involves measuring your face with a ruler or tape measure. Measure the distance between your hairline and chin, and then measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. Once you have these measurements, you can compare them to the following face shapes:</p><ul><li>Oval</li><li>Round</li><li>Square</li><li>Rectangle</li><li>Diamond</li><li>Heart</li></ul><p>Depending on your measurements, you may have a combination of two or more face shapes.

For example, if you have a round face, a short, layered cut can help elongate your features.</li><li>Wear glasses that flatter your face shape. For example, rectangular frames can balance out a round face.</li><li>Use makeup to highlight your best features.
