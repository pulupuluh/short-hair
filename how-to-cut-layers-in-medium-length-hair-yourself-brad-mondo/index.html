Do you want to switch up your hairstyle without breaking the bank? Well, you're in luck! Cutting layers in your medium length hair is easier than you think, and with the guidance of hair expert Brad Mondo, you can master the technique in no time.</p><h2> Description </h2><p>Layered hair is a popular hairstyle that adds volume and texture to any hair type. It's a versatile look that can be styled in many ways and is perfect for those with medium length hair. In this blog post, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to cut layers in your medium length hair all by yourself. We will be using Brad Mondo's technique to ensure you achieve the best results.</p><h2> How to </h2><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You will need a sharp pair of scissors, a comb, and some hair clips to section your hair. Once you have all the necessary tools, follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><h3> Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair </h3><p>It's essential to start with clean and dry hair. Wash your hair with your favorite shampoo and conditioner, and then dry it completely using a hairdryer. Make sure your hair is tangle-free before you begin cutting.</p><h3> Step 2: Part Your Hair </h3><p>Part your hair in the middle or on the side, depending on your preference. Use the comb to create a clean part and section your hair into two equal parts.</p><h3> Step 3: Cut the Bottom Layer </h3><p>Take one section of your hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut the ends of the hair in a straight line. This will be the bottom layer of your hair.</p><h3> Step 4: Cut the Middle Layer </h3><p>Once you have cut the bottom layer, take the next section of hair above it and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it at an angle. Start from the front and work your way to the back, making sure the length of the hair is the same on both sides. This will create the middle layer of your hair.</p><h3> Step 5: Cut the Top Layer </h3><p>Finally, take the top section of your hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it at a steeper angle than the middle layer. Start from the front and work your way to the back, making sure the length of the hair is the same on both sides. This will create the top layer of your hair.</p><h3> Step 6: Blend the Layers </h3><p>Once you have cut all the layers, use the scissors to blend them together. Cut into the layers at an angle to create a seamless transition between them.</p><h3> Step 7: Check for Evenness </h3><p>After you have finished cutting, check to make sure that the layers are even. If you notice any unevenness, go back and trim the hair until you are satisfied with the results.</p><h3> Step 8: Style Your Hair </h3><p>Once you are happy with your new layered haircut, style it however you like. You can add some volumizing spray or texturizing powder to create a more textured look.</p><h2> Tips </h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting layers in your medium length hair:</p><ul><li>Start with small cuts and work your way up. You can always cut more hair, but you can't put it back once it's been cut.</li><li>Make sure your scissors are sharp. Dull scissors can cause split ends and damage your hair.</li><li>Take breaks if you need to. Cutting your hair can be tiring, so take a break if your arms start to feel tired.</li><li>Don't cut too much hair at once. It's better to cut small sections of hair and work your way up.</li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Is it easy to cut layers in medium length hair by yourself? </h3><p>Yes, it is easy to cut layers in medium length hair by yourself if you follow the right technique and have the right tools.</p><h3> What tools do I need to cut layers in my hair? </h3><p>You will need a sharp pair of scissors, a comb, and some hair clips to section your hair.</p><h3> Can I cut layers in my hair if I have curly hair? </h3><p>Yes, you can cut layers in your hair if you have curly hair. However, it's important to be cautious and take small sections of hair at a time to avoid any mistakes.</p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>After you have cut your hair, it's essential to take good care of it. Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair moisturized, and avoid using heat styling tools too often. Trim your hair every 8-12 weeks to keep it looking healthy and prevent split ends.</p><p>Cutting layers in medium length hair yourself can be a fun and cost-effective way to switch up your hairstyle. With the right tools and technique, you can achieve salon-worthy results from the comfort of your own home. So, what are you waiting for? Grab your scissors and start cutting!</p></article>
