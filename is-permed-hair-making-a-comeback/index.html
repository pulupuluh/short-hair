But in recent years, the trend has faded away, with more women opting for straight, sleek hair instead. However, in the past year, we've seen a resurgence of permed hair on the runways and in fashion magazines. So, is permed hair making a comeback? Let's take a deeper look.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Permed hair is a chemical process that adds curls or waves to straight hair. It involves wrapping sections of hair around perm rods and then applying a perming solution that breaks down the hair's natural bonds and reform them in a new shape. The result is bouncy, curly hair that lasts for months.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you're interested in getting a perm, it's important to find a skilled hairstylist who has experience with the process. Here's what you can expect during a perm appointment:</p><h3>Consultation</h3><p>Your stylist will discuss the perming process with you and ask about your hair history, including any previous color or chemical treatments. They will also assess your hair's texture and condition to determine if it's suitable for a perm.</p><h3>Preparation</h3><p>Your stylist will shampoo your hair to remove any buildup or styling products. They will then wrap your hair around perm rods in the desired size and shape.</p><h3>Perming Solution</h3><p>Your stylist will apply a perming solution to your hair, covering each rod thoroughly. The solution will break down the hair's natural bonds, allowing it to take on a new shape.</p><h3>Neutralizer</h3><p>After the perming solution has been applied, your stylist will rinse your hair thoroughly and apply a neutralizer to stop the perming process. The neutralizer will re-bond the hair's new shape in place.</p><h3>Finishing</h3><p>Your stylist will remove the perm rods, gently comb through your hair, and rinse it one final time. They may apply a conditioning treatment to help nourish and hydrate your hair.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>If you're considering a perm, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Choose a skilled hairstylist who has experience with perming.</li><li>Wait at least two weeks after coloring or chemically treating your hair before getting a perm.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair for 48 hours after the perm to allow the new shape to set.</li><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to help maintain your perm.</li><li>Avoid heat styling tools, as they can damage your perm and cause it to lose its shape.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How long does a perm last?</h3><p>A perm can last for several months, depending on your hair's texture and how well you care for it. As your hair grows, the perm will eventually grow out and need to be redone.</p><h3>Can I get a perm if my hair is already curly?</h3><p>It's not recommended to get a perm if your hair is already curly, as it can damage your hair and cause it to become too curly or frizzy.</p><h3>Can I color my hair after getting a perm?</h3><p>It's best to wait at least two weeks after getting a perm before coloring your hair, as the chemicals can be harsh on your hair and cause damage.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>If you've decided to get a perm, it's important to take good care of your hair afterward to help maintain its shape and prevent damage. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Avoid washing your hair for the first 48 hours after getting a perm.</li><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to help maintain your perm.</li><li>Avoid heat styling tools, as they can damage your perm and cause it to lose its shape.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's wet, as it can cause breakage.</li><li>Treat your hair to a deep conditioning treatment once a week to help keep it hydrated and healthy.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, permed hair is indeed making a comeback, with many women embracing the tight curls and voluminous styles of the 80s and 90s. However, it's important to find a skilled hairstylist and take good care of your hair after getting a perm to ensure it looks its best and stays healthy.</p></article>
