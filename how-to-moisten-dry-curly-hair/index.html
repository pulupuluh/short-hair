Regular conditioners aren't formulated to be left on your hair for extended periods of time, so they can actually end up drying out your hair if you use them as a leave-in.</p><h3>Q: How often should I use a deep conditioning treatment?</h3><p>A: It depends on your hair type and how damaged it is. If your hair is very dry or damaged, you may want to use a deep conditioning treatment once a week. If your hair is relatively healthy, once a month should suffice.</p><h3>Q: Can I use a hair oil on my roots?</h3><p>A: It's generally not recommended, as oils can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy. Focus on applying the oil to the ends of your hair instead.</p><h2 id="hair-care">General Hair Care Advice</h2><p>Here are some general tips for taking care of your hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid using heat tools as much as possible.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends.</li><li>Don't brush your hair when it's wet, as this can cause breakage.
