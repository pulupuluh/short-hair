As we get older, the cells in our hair follicles gradually stop producing pigment, which gives our hair its color. When this happens, the hair strand becomes transparent and appears gray or white against the skin.</p><p>The exact age at which hair turns gray varies from person to person, but for most people, it begins in their 30s or 40s. However, some people may start to notice gray hairs as early as their 20s.</p><h3 id="genetics">Genetics and Gray Hair</h3><p>Genetics plays a role in when and how quickly hair turns gray. If your parents or grandparents went gray early, there is a good chance that you will too. Additionally, some medical conditions, such as vitiligo and thyroid disorders, can cause premature graying.</p><h3 id="stress">Stress and Gray Hair</h3><p>While stress is not a direct cause of gray hair, it can accelerate the graying process. When we are under stress, our bodies produce a hormone called cortisol, which can damage the cells that produce hair pigment. This can lead to premature graying.</p><h3 id="smoking">Smoking and Gray Hair</h3><p>Smoking has been linked to premature graying. The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the cells that produce hair pigment, leading to gray hair at a younger age.</p><h3 id="vitamins">Vitamins and Gray Hair</h3><p>While there is no magic pill to prevent gray hair, getting enough of certain vitamins and minerals can help keep your hair healthy. Vitamin B12, for example, is essential for healthy hair growth and can be found in meat, fish, and dairy products. Vitamin D, which we get from sunlight and fortified foods, can also promote healthy hair growth.</p><h2 id="haircare">Hair Care for Gray Hair</h2><p>Gray hair is often drier and more brittle than pigmented hair, so it is important to take extra care of it.
