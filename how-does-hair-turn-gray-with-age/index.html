As we get older, the cells in our hair follicles gradually stop producing pigment, which gives our hair its color. When this happens, the hair strand becomes transparent and appears gray or white against the skin.</p><p>The exact age at which hair turns gray varies from person to person, but for most people, it begins in their 30s or 40s.

Additionally, some medical conditions, such as vitiligo and thyroid disorders, can cause premature graying.</p><h3 id="stress">Stress and Gray Hair</h3><p>While stress is not a direct cause of gray hair, it can accelerate the graying process. When we are under stress, our bodies produce a hormone called cortisol, which can damage the cells that produce hair pigment.

The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the cells that produce hair pigment, leading to gray hair at a younger age.</p><h3 id="vitamins">Vitamins and Gray Hair</h3><p>While there is no magic pill to prevent gray hair, getting enough of certain vitamins and minerals can help keep your hair healthy.
