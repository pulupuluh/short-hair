One common cause is genetics. Some people are simply born with hair that grows in this pattern. Another cause can be hair damage from styling habits, such as wearing tight hairstyles or using heat tools excessively. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menopause, can also affect hair growth patterns.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you are dealing with short hair in the middle of your head, there are some steps you can take to help promote hair growth and prevent further damage.</p><h3>1.

Try to limit your use of these tools or use a heat protectant spray to help minimize damage.</p><h3>3.
