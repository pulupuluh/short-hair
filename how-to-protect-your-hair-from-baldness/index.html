Look for supplements that contain biotin, vitamin D, and iron.</p><h3>4. Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Avoid hairstyles that pull your hair tight, such as braids, ponytails, and buns. These hairstyles can damage your hair and lead to hair loss.</p><h3>5. Protect Your Hair from Heat</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools on your hair, such as hair dryers, curling irons, and flat irons. If you must use these tools, use them on a low heat setting and use a heat protectant spray.</p><h3>6. Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>Avoid pulling, tugging, or brushing your hair too hard.
