Some of the best beard styles for this face shape include:</p><ul><li>Stubble</li><li>Short Beard</li><li>Extended Goatee</li><li>Soul Patch</li><li>Van Dyke</li></ul><p>Each of these beard styles can be tailored to suit your personal taste and style. Whether you prefer a clean-shaven look or a full beard, there's a style that will work for you.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Best Beard Style</h2><p>The key to choosing the best beard style for a round face and bald head is to find a style that will create the illusion of length. This means avoiding styles that are too wide or full, as they can make your face appear rounder.</p><p>Aim for a beard style that is narrower at the chin and fuller at the sides. This will help to elongate your face and create a more balanced look. You can also experiment with different lengths and shapes to find a style that suits your face shape and personal style.</p><h3>Stubble</h3><p>Stubble is a great option for men with a round face and bald head. This style is low maintenance and easy to maintain, making it perfect for guys who don't want to spend a lot of time grooming their beard. To achieve the perfect stubble, simply let your facial hair grow for a few days and then trim it down to a short length using a beard trimmer.</p><h3>Short Beard</h3><p>A short beard is another great option for guys with a round face and bald head. This style is slightly longer than stubble but still maintains a narrow shape. To achieve a short beard, let your facial hair grow for a few weeks and then trim it down using a beard trimmer. You can also use scissors to trim any stray hairs and shape your beard to your desired length.</p><h3>Extended Goatee</h3><p>An extended goatee is a popular beard style that works well for guys with a round face and bald head. This style features a small beard on the chin that extends down to the jawline. To achieve an extended goatee, let your facial hair grow for a few weeks and then trim it down using a beard trimmer. You can also use scissors to shape your beard and create a narrow, elongated look.</p><h3>Soul Patch</h3><p>A soul patch is a small patch of hair located just below the lower lip. This style is simple and easy to maintain, making it a great option for guys with a round face and bald head. To achieve a soul patch, simply let your facial hair grow for a few days and then shave everything except the patch of hair just below your lower lip.</p><h3>Van Dyke</h3><p>A Van Dyke is a beard style that features a mustache and a small beard on the chin. This style is narrow and elongated, making it a great option for guys with a round face and bald head.
