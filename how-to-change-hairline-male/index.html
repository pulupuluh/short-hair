It is often used to create the illusion of a fuller head of hair or to conceal scars or bald spots.</p><h3>Is hair transplant surgery a permanent solution?</h3><p>While hair transplant surgery can provide long-lasting results, it is not a permanent solution. Hair loss can still occur in other areas of the scalp, and additional procedures may be required in the future.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Maintaining Hairline</h2><p>Regardless of which method you choose to change your hairline, it's essential to maintain healthy hair and scalp to ensure the best results.
