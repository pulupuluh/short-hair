Long curly hair can be the perfect hairstyle for this face shape as it helps to balance out the face and add some width to the jawline. However, styling long curly hair can be a challenge, especially if you're new to it. That's why we've put together this guide to help you style your long curly hair with ease.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Style Long Curly Hair for Heart Shaped Face</h2><p>Styling long curly hair for heart-shaped faces can be done in various ways. Here are some of the ways you can style your long curly hair:</p><h3>1. Half-Up Half-Down</h3><p>The half-up half-down style is a classic and easy way to style your long curly hair. To achieve this look, take the top half of your hair and tie it into a bun or ponytail, leaving the rest of your hair loose.</p><h3>2. High Ponytail</h3><p>A high ponytail is a simple but elegant way to style your long curly hair. Pull all your hair up into a high ponytail and secure it with a hair tie. You can also add some curls to the ends of your ponytail to add some volume and dimension.</p><h3>3. Braids</h3><p>Braids are a versatile hairstyle that can be worn in many ways. You can try a fishtail braid, a French braid, or a simple three-strand braid. Braids not only add some texture and dimension to your hair but also help to keep it out of your face.</p><h3>4. Messy Bun</h3><p>A messy bun is a great way to style your long curly hair if you're in a hurry. Pull your hair up into a high ponytail, twist it around, and secure it with bobby pins. Pull out a few strands to create a messy, effortless look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step: How to Style Long Curly Hair for Heart Shaped Face</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to style your long curly hair for heart-shaped faces:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>The first step to styling your long curly hair is to wash and condition it. Use a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type and follow the instructions on the label.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair to help detangle it and reduce frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the conditioner evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your hair to help define your curls. You can use a curl cream, mousse, or gel, depending on your hair type and preference. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow-dry your hair using a diffuser attachment to help enhance your curls. Use a low heat setting and move the diffuser around your head, scrunching your curls as you go.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Choose one of the styling options mentioned above and style your hair accordingly. You can also experiment with different hairstyles and find what works best for you.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Styling Long Curly Hair for Heart Shaped Face</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you style your long curly hair:</p><h3>1.

Heat protectants help to reduce breakage and keep your hair healthy.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>1.

However, make sure to use a color-safe shampoo and conditioner and avoid using heat styling tools too often as it can damage your hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Long Curly Hair for Heart Shaped Face</h2><p>Here are some tips for taking care of your long curly hair:</p><h3>1.
