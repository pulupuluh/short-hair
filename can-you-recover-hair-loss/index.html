There are several medications available that can help slow or stop hair loss and even promote new hair growth. Some of these medications include finasteride, minoxidil, and spironolactone.</p><h3>Step 3: Consider Hair Transplant Surgery</h3><p>If your hair loss is due to genetics or other factors, hair transplant surgery may be an option.
