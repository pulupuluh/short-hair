Can I (honestly) pull off a pixie haircut?</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>If you're thinking about getting a pixie cut, you might be wondering if it will suit your face shape. Pixie cuts are a great hairstyle for those who want to have a low-maintenance, edgy look. However, not every face shape can pull off a pixie cut. In this article, we'll discuss what face shapes can pull off a pixie cut and provide some tips on how to style and care for your new haircut.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ol><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>A pixie cut is a short hairstyle that is usually cut close to the head. It is a popular choice for those who want a low-maintenance hairstyle that still looks great. Pixie cuts can be styled in a variety of ways, from sleek and straight to messy and textured. However, not every face shape can pull off a pixie cut. It's important to consider your face shape when choosing a pixie cut to ensure that it will look good on you.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>Before getting a pixie cut, it's important to determine your face shape. There are six main face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and long. Each face shape has its own characteristics and features that can affect how a pixie cut will look on you.</p><h3>Oval Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oval face shape, you're in luck! Oval faces are considered the most versatile face shape and can pull off almost any hairstyle, including a pixie cut. The key to styling a pixie cut on an oval face is to create balance and not make the face look too long or too wide.</p><h3>Round Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a round face shape, a pixie cut can still work for you. However, it's important to choose a pixie cut that creates height and volume on the top of the head to elongate the face. Avoid straight and blunt cuts, as they can make the face look wider.</p><h3>Square Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a square face shape, a pixie cut can help soften your features. Choose a pixie cut with layers and texture to create movement and soften the angles of the face. Avoid straight and blunt cuts, as they can make the face look boxy.</p><h3>Heart Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a heart face shape, a pixie cut can work for you if it's styled correctly. Choose a pixie cut with layers and volume on the top of the head to balance out the width of the forehead. Avoid cuts that are too short on the sides, as they can make the face look wider at the top.</p><h3>Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a diamond face shape, a pixie cut can help accentuate your cheekbones. Choose a pixie cut that creates volume on the top of the head and has textured layers on the sides to soften the jawline. Avoid cuts that are too short on the sides, as they can make the face look wider at the top.</p><h3>Long Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a long face shape, a pixie cut can help make your face look shorter. Choose a pixie cut with volume and texture on the sides to create width and balance. Avoid cuts that are too short on the sides, as they can make the face look longer.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>Once you've determined your face shape and chosen a pixie cut that will suit you, it's important to know how to style and maintain your new haircut. Here are some steps to follow:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair with products that are suitable for your hair type.</li><li>Towel dry your hair and apply a styling product, such as mousse or gel.</li><li>Blow dry your hair using a round brush to create volume and texture.</li><li>Use a flat iron or curling iron to style your hair as desired.</li><li>Finish off with a hairspray or hair oil to add shine and hold.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when getting a pixie cut:</p><ul><li>Bring a picture of the pixie cut you want to your stylist to ensure that they understand your vision.</li><li>Be prepared for a drastic change, especially if you're used to having longer hair.</li><li>Consider your lifestyle and how a pixie cut will fit into it. Pixie cuts require regular maintenance and styling.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products and techniques to find what works best for your hair type and texture.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>How often do I need to get my pixie cut trimmed?</h3><p>Pixie cuts require regular maintenance to keep them looking sharp. It's recommended that you get your hair trimmed every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and style of your pixie cut.</p><h3>Can I still style my pixie cut if I have curly hair?</h3><p>Absolutely! Pixie cuts can look great on curly hair. Just make sure to choose a cut that works with your hair's natural texture and use products that are designed for curly hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Here are some tips for caring for your pixie cut:</p><ul><li>Wash and condition your hair regularly with products that are suitable for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid heat styling tools as much as possible to prevent damage to your hair.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and environmental damage by wearing a hat or using a leave-in conditioner with SPF.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what face shape can pull off a pixie cut, you can confidently go to your stylist and ask for the perfect cut for you. Remember to consider your face shape, lifestyle, and hair type when choosing a pixie cut, and don't be afraid to experiment with different styling techniques and products.
