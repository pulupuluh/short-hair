To achieve a well-blended hairstyle, you need to ensure that the length transition from short to long is seamless. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Decide on the length of the sides and the top</h3><p>The first step is to decide on the length of the sides and the top. Typically, the sides should be shaved or trimmed short using clippers, while the top is left long. You can decide how short or long you want the sides to be, but we recommend going with a 1 or 2 clipper guard length for a cleaner look.</p><h3>2. Use a comb to blend the sides and the top</h3><p>Once you've decided on the length of the sides and the top, it's time to blend them together. Use a comb to create a seamless transition from the sides to the top. Start by combing the hair on the sides upwards and towards the top. Then, use a pair of scissors to trim any stray hairs that are sticking out. </p><h3>3. Trim the top to your desired length</h3><p>Now that you've blended the sides and the top, it's time to trim the top to your desired length. Use a pair of scissors to cut the hair evenly across the top. Make sure to leave some length at the front so that you can style it later. </p><h3>4. Style your hair</h3><p>Once you've trimmed the top to your desired length, it's time to style your hair. You can use a hair product such as pomade or wax to create a sleek and polished look.
