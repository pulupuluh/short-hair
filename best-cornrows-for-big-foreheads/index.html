Not only do they look stylish and trendy, but they can also help to balance out your facial features. However, it can be difficult to find the right cornrow style that complements your forehead size and shape. In this article, we will give you tips, step-by-step guide, and some of the best cornrow styles to flatter your big forehead. </p><h2> How to Choose the Best Cornrow Style for Your Big Forehead </h2><p> When choosing the best cornrow style for your big forehead, there are a few things to consider. </p><h3> 1. Hairline </h3><p> Your hairline will determine the type of cornrow style that will work best for you. If you have a high hairline, you may want to choose a style that covers your forehead. On the other hand, if you have a low hairline, you may want to choose a style that exposes your forehead. </p><h3> 2. Face Shape </h3><p> Your face shape can also influence the type of cornrow style that will look best on you. If you have a round face, you may want to choose a style that creates length and height. If you have a long face, you may want to choose a style that adds volume to the sides of your face. </p><h3> 3. Personal Style </h3><p> It's important to choose a cornrow style that reflects your personal style and personality. Whether you prefer a simple, classic style or a bold, trendy look, there is a cornrow style that will suit your individual taste. </p><h2> Step-by-Step Guide: How to Create Cornrows for Big Foreheads </h2><p> Here is a step-by-step guide to creating cornrows for big foreheads: </p><h3> Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair </h3><p> Start by washing and conditioning your hair. This will make it easier to section and braid your hair. </p><h3> Step 2: Detangle Your Hair </h3><p> Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. This will help to prevent breakage and make it easier to braid your hair. </p><h3> Step 3: Section Your Hair </h3><p> Use a tail comb to section your hair into small, even sections. The size of the sections will depend on the size of the cornrows you want to create. </p><h3> Step 4: Create the Cornrows </h3><p> Begin braiding your hair, starting at the hairline and working your way back. Take small sections of hair and braid them tightly, keeping the braids close to the scalp. Continue braiding until you have completed all of the sections. </p><h3> Step 5: Secure the Ends </h3><p> Once you have braided all of the sections, use a small elastic band to secure the ends of the cornrows. </p><h2> Best Cornrow Styles for Big Foreheads </h2><p> Here are some of the best cornrow styles for big foreheads: </p><h3> 1. Center Part Cornrows </h3><p> Center part cornrows are a classic and simple style that works well for big foreheads. The center part creates a symmetrical look that balances out the forehead. </p><h3> 2. Side-Swept Cornrows </h3><p> Side-swept cornrows are a great option for those who want to create volume and length on one side of their face. This style can also help to soften a square jawline. </p><h3> 3. Zig-Zag Cornrows </h3><p> Zig-zag cornrows are a fun and trendy style that works well for those with big foreheads. The zig-zag pattern creates a unique look that draws attention away from the forehead. </p><h2> Tips for Maintaining Your Cornrows </h2><p> Here are some tips for maintaining your cornrows: </p> - Keep your scalp moisturized with a lightweight oil or serum. - Don't leave your cornrows in for too long, as this can cause breakage and damage to your hair. - Use a silk scarf or bonnet to protect your cornrows while you sleep. - Avoid wearing tight hats or headbands that can pull on your cornrows. <h2> FAQ: </h2><h3> Can I get cornrows if I have a big forehead? </h3><p> Yes, you can definitely get cornrows if you have a big forehead. In fact, cornrows can be a great way to balance out your facial features and create a stylish look. </p><h3> How often should I wash my cornrows? </h3><p> You should wash your cornrows every 1-2 weeks, depending on how oily your scalp gets. </p><h3> How long can I leave my cornrows in? </h3><p> It's best to leave your cornrows in for no more than 6-8 weeks to prevent breakage and damage to your hair. </p><h2> Hair Care: </h2><p> To maintain healthy hair while wearing cornrows, it's important to: </p> - Keep your scalp moisturized with lightweight oils or serums. - Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that won't strip your hair of its natural oils. - Avoid using heat styling tools on your hair. - Protect your hair with a silk scarf or bonnet while you sleep. - Eat a balanced diet that is rich in vitamins and nutrients. <p> In conclusion, cornrows can be a great hairstyle option for those with big foreheads.
