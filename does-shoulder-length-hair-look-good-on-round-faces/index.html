It's versatile, easy to style, and can be dressed up or down for any occasion. However, if you have a round face, you may be wondering if shoulder length hair will look good on you.</p><p>The answer is yes! Shoulder length hair can look great on round faces, as long as you choose the right style and cut. In this article, we'll explore the best shoulder length hairstyles for round faces, and provide tips on how to style and care for your hair.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The key to making shoulder length hair work for a round face is to choose a style that adds length and height to the face. This can be achieved through layers, bangs, and volume at the crown of the head. Here are some of the best shoulder length hairstyles for round faces:</p><h3>1. Layered Lob</h3><p>The layered lob, or long bob, is a popular hairstyle that looks great on round faces. The layers add movement and dimension to the hair, while the length elongates the face. This style works best when the layers are kept longer, rather than choppy or short.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great option for round faces, as they draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones, while also adding length to the face. This style works well with shoulder length hair, as it adds a touch of femininity and softness to the overall look.</p><h3>3. Wavy Bob</h3><p>A wavy bob is a great choice for those who want a more relaxed, casual look. The waves add texture and movement to the hair, while the length elongates the face. This style works well with a side part, as it adds volume and height to the crown of the head.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here's how to style your shoulder length hair for a round face:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before styling. Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and lift to your hair.</p><h3>2. Apply a heat protectant</h3><p>Use a heat protectant spray or serum to protect your hair from damage caused by heat styling tools.</p><h3>3. Create volume at the crown</h3><p>Use a round brush and blow dryer to create volume at the crown of your head. This will help elongate your face and balance out your features.</p><h3>4. Add waves or curls</h3><p>Use a curling iron or wand to add waves or curls to your hair. This will add texture and movement to your hair, and further elongate your face.</p><h3>5. Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Spray a light hold hairspray all over your hair to set the style and keep it in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for styling shoulder length hair on a round face:</p><ul><li>Choose a style that adds height and length to your face</li><li>Avoid styles that are too blunt or choppy, as they can make your face appear wider</li><li>Experiment with different partings to find what works best for you</li><li>Use a volumizing mousse or spray to add body to your hair</li><li>Invest in a good quality heat styling tool to prevent damage to your hair</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I wear my shoulder length hair straight?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can wear your hair straight, but make sure to add volume at the crown of your head to elongate your face.</p><h3>Q: Should I avoid bangs if I have a round face?</h3><p>A: No, you can still wear bangs, but opt for side-swept bangs rather than blunt or straight across bangs.</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my shoulder length hair?</h3><p>A: It depends on your hair type and lifestyle, but typically every 2-3 days is sufficient.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your shoulder length hair looking its best, it's important to follow a good hair care routine. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Avoid using hot tools every day</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week</li><li>Trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's wet, as it can cause breakage</li></ul><p>By following these tips and choosing the right shoulder length hairstyle, you can rock a fabulous look that will flatter your round face.</p></article>
