This hair type is characterized by defined curls that range from loose to tight, and it's often the most challenging to manage. In this article, we'll dive deeper into the most common curly hair type, explore tips for caring for your locks, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p><h2>What is Type 3 Curly Hair?</h2><p>Type 3 curly hair is characterized by S-shaped curls that range from loose to tight. This hair type is further broken down into three subtypes:</p><h3>Type 3a:</h3><p>Type 3a curls are the loosest of the type 3 curls. They are defined and springy, but they have a lot of bounce and can be easily straightened.</p><h3>Type 3b:</h3><p>Type 3b curls are tighter than 3a curls and have a more defined S-shape. They often have a lot of volume and can be prone to frizz.</p><h3>Type 3c:</h3><p>Type 3c curls are the tightest of the type 3 curls. They have a corkscrew shape and are densely packed. They can be prone to dryness and require a lot of moisture to thrive.</p><h2>How to Care for Type 3 Curly Hair</h2><p>Caring for type 3 curly hair can be challenging, but with the right techniques and products, you can keep your locks healthy and defined. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize</h3><p>Type 3 curls tend to be dry, so it's essential to keep them moisturized.
