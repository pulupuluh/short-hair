You want a primer that is hydrating, lightweight, and long-lasting, and that can help smooth out any fine lines and wrinkles. Here are some of the best eyeshadow primers for over 60:</p><ul><li><strong>Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion</strong> - This cult-favorite primer is perfect for mature skin, as it helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, and keeps your eyeshadow in place for up to 24 hours.</li><li><strong>MAC Prep + Prime 24-Hour Extend Eye Base</strong> - This primer is perfect for those with dry or crepey eyelids, as it hydrates and plumps the skin, while keeping your eyeshadow in place all day long.</li><li><strong>Too Faced Shadow Insurance Eyeshadow Primer</strong> - This primer is perfect for those with oily eyelids, as it helps control oil and keeps your eyeshadow from creasing or fading throughout the day.</li></ul><h2 id="tips">Tips for Applying Eyeshadow Primer</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you get the most out of your eyeshadow primer:</p><ul><li>Use a small amount of primer and blend it well to avoid creasing.</li><li>Apply primer not only on your eyelids but also under the eyes to avoid concealer creasing.</li><li>If you're in a rush, you can use your fingers to apply the primer, but a brush can give you a more precise application.</li><li>Wait for a few seconds to let the primer dry before applying eyeshadow.</li><li>If you have hooded eyes, apply the primer slightly above the crease to prevent smudging.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs about Eyeshadow Primer</h2><h3>Q: Can I use concealer as an eyeshadow primer?</h3><p>A: While concealer can work as a makeshift eyeshadow primer, it's not recommended as it can crease and fade faster than a dedicated primer. Plus, eyeshadow primer has additional benefits such as smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles and controlling oil.</p><h3>Q: Can I wear eyeshadow primer without eyeshadow?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can wear eyeshadow primer without eyeshadow, especially if you want to even out your skin tone and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p><h3>Q: How often should I replace my eyeshadow primer?</h3><p>A: Eyeshadow primer can last up to six months to a year, depending on how often you use it. Make sure to check the expiration date and replace it if it smells or looks different than when you first bought it.</p><h3>Q: Can eyeshadow primer cause an allergic reaction?</h3><p>A: While it's rare, eyeshadow primer can cause an allergic reaction in some people. If you experience any redness, itching, or swelling, stop using the primer immediately and consult a dermatologist.</p><h2>Hair Care for Over 60s</h2><p>While eyeshadow primer can help you achieve a flawless makeup look, taking care of your hair is just as important. As we age, our hair becomes thinner and drier, and we may notice more gray or white strands. Here are some hair care tips for over 60s:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that is formulated for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, as they can damage your hair and make it look even thinner.</li><li>If you want to color your hair, opt for a natural-looking shade that complements your skin tone.</li><li>Consider getting a shorter haircut, as it can make your hair look fuller and more voluminous.</li></ul></body></html></article>
