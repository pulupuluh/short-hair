The goal of a long haircut for this face shape is to balance out the forehead and chin while accentuating the cheekbones. Layers are key to achieving this look. They soften the angles of the face and add movement to long hair. Here are our top picks for long haircuts for heart-shaped faces in 2023.</p><h3>1. Long Layers</h3><p>A long layer cut is the most versatile and flattering style for heart-shaped faces. It adds volume and texture to the hair, which balances out the face's proportions. The layers should start at the chin and blend downward. This cut is perfect for those who want to keep their hair long and flowing.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>If you want to add a little drama to your long haircut, side-swept bangs are the way to go. They draw attention to your eyes and cheekbones while softening your forehead's width. This style works best for those with long and thick hair.</p><h3>3. Face-Framing Layers</h3><p>Face-framing layers start at the cheekbones and add softness and dimension to the hair. They bring attention to the eyes and cheekbones, making them perfect for heart-shaped faces. This style works on all hair types and lengths.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Right Haircut</h2><p>Choosing the right haircut for your heart-shaped face can be overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.
