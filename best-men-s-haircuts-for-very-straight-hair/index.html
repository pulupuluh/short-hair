If you have very fine hair, you'll want to avoid styles that require a lot of volume. On the other hand, if you have thick hair, you may want to consider a layered cut to help reduce the weight and make it easier to manage.</p><p>Finally, consider your personal style and how much time you're willing to devote to styling your hair each day.
