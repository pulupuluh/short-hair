You'll need a good pair of hair cutting scissors, hair clips to section your hair, and a comb. It's also a good idea to have a handheld mirror so you can see the back of your head.</p><p>Cutting your own hair can be nerve-wracking, but take it slow and remember that you can always cut more hair later. Start with small sections of hair and work your way around your head, checking your progress in the mirror as you go. Make sure to cut your hair when it's dry, as wet hair can appear longer and you may end up cutting too much.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>1. Start by sectioning your hair. Use hair clips to separate your hair into four sections - two at the front and two at the back.</p><p>2. Take a small section of hair from the back and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers, with your fingers pointing downwards. Use your scissors to trim the ends of the hair, cutting in a straight line.</p><p>3. Move on to the next section of hair, working your way around your head. Take small sections of hair and trim the ends in a straight line, making sure to cut away any split ends.</p><p>4. Once you've finished trimming the length of your hair, you can add layers if you want to. Take a small section of hair from the top of your head and comb it straight up. Hold the hair between your fingers, with your fingers pointing upwards. Use your scissors to cut into the hair, making small snips to create layers.</p><p>5.
