Use a shampoo and conditioner that's specifically designed for thick curly hair, and make sure to rinse thoroughly to avoid any product buildup.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>After washing and conditioning your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner to help detangle and hydrate your curls. This will also help to protect your hair from heat damage if you plan on using any hot tools later on.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Curl-Enhancing Cream</h3><p>Next, apply a curl-enhancing cream to help define and enhance your natural curls. Work the product through your hair from root to tip, making sure to distribute it evenly.</p><h3>Step 4: Use Texturizing Spray</h3><p>If you want to add some extra texture and volume to your hair, use a texturizing spray. This will give your curls a more natural, messy look that's perfect for casual occasions.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Now it's time to style your hair.
