Check your hair texture</h3><p>If you have curly or kinky hair, your hair may be suitable for dreadlocks even if it is not very thick.

Shampoo and condition your hair thoroughly.</p><h3>2. Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using a comb. The size of the sections will depend on the thickness and length of your hair.</p><h3>3. Backcomb the sections</h3><p>Starting at the roots, use a small-toothed comb to backcomb each section of hair. This will create knots that will eventually form into dreadlocks.</p><h3>4. Twist and knot the hair</h3><p>Once you have backcombed each section, twist and knot the hair, working your way down to the ends.
