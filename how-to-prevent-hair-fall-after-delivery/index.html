Don't worry, it's a common postpartum symptom that affects many women. In fact, around 50% of women experience hair loss after delivery. The good news is that there are ways to prevent it. Here's a guide on how to prevent hair fall after delivery.</p><h2>Table of Content</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Prevent Hair Fall After Delivery</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall After Delivery</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care After Delivery</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Prevent Hair Fall After Delivery</h2><p>The first step in preventing hair fall after delivery is to understand why it happens. During pregnancy, the increased levels of estrogen in your body prevent hair from falling out. After delivery, the estrogen levels in your body drop, and your hair begins to fall out. The good news is that this is temporary, and your hair will grow back. However, there are things you can do to prevent excessive hair fall. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet is essential for preventing hair fall after delivery. Make sure you are eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. These foods provide the nutrients your body needs to produce healthy hair.</p><h3>2. Take Postpartum Vitamins</h3><p>Postpartum vitamins can help prevent hair fall by providing your body with the nutrients it needs. Look for a vitamin that contains biotin, which is essential for healthy hair growth.</p><h3>3. Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Avoid tight hairstyles that pull on your hair, such as braids or ponytails. These styles can cause hair breakage and lead to hair fall. Instead, opt for loose hairstyles that don't put stress on your hair.</p><h3>4. Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>Be gentle with your hair when you brush or style it. Avoid brushing your hair when it's wet, as it's more vulnerable to breakage. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step by step guide on how to prevent hair fall after delivery:</p><h3>Step 1: Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.</p><h3>Step 2: Take Postpartum Vitamins</h3><p>Take postpartum vitamins that contain biotin.</p><h3>Step 3: Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Avoid tight hairstyles that pull on your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>Be gentle with your hair when you brush or style it.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall After Delivery</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to prevent hair fall after delivery:</p><h3>1.
