Look no further! In this article, we will discuss the top hair styles for women over 50 with an oval face shape. Keep reading to find the perfect hair style for you!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>An oval face shape is considered to be the most versatile face shape. It is characterized by a slightly wider forehead and rounded chin, with the cheekbones being the widest part of the face. Women with oval face shapes have the advantage of being able to pull off a variety of hair styles. However, as we age, it’s important to consider hair styles that flatter our face shape and bring out our best features.</p><h2>How To Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>Not sure if you have an oval face shape? Here’s how to determine your face shape:</p><ol><li>Take a photo of yourself facing the camera.</li><li>Print out the photo and draw a line around the edge of your face.</li><li>Compare the shape of your face to the following face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, and diamond.</li></ol><p>If the widest part of your face is your cheekbones and your face tapers to a rounded chin, you have an oval face shape.</p><h2>Top Hair Styles for Oval Face over 50</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, let’s discuss the top hair styles for women over 50 with an oval face shape:</p><h3>1. Bob</h3><p>A bob is a classic hair style that never goes out of style. It’s a great option for women over 50 with an oval face shape because it draws attention to the cheekbones and frames the face. A chin-length bob with layers is a great option for thinning hair, as it adds volume and texture.</p><h3>2. Pixie</h3><p>A pixie cut is a bold and daring hair style that can be incredibly flattering for women over 50 with an oval face shape. It draws attention to the eyes and cheekbones and can be customized to suit your personality and style. A short, layered pixie cut with side-swept bangs is a great option for women who want to keep their hair short and easy to maintain.</p><h3>3. Shoulder-Length Layers</h3><p>If you prefer longer hair, shoulder-length layers are a great option for women over 50 with an oval face shape. Layers add volume and texture to the hair, which can be especially beneficial for thinning hair. To add dimension to the hair, consider adding highlights or lowlights.</p><h3>4. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>If you want to add some interest to your hair without making a drastic change, consider adding side-swept bangs. They draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones and can be customized to suit your face shape and personal style.</p><h2>Step By Step Guide to Achieving Your Best Hair Style</h2><p>Now that you’ve decided on the perfect hair style for your oval face shape, here’s a step-by-step guide to achieving your best hair style:</p><ol><li>Find a reputable hair stylist who has experience working with women over 50.</li><li>Bring a photo of the hair style you want to your appointment.</li><li>Discuss any concerns or challenges you may have with your hair stylist.</li><li>Maintain your hair style with regular trims and conditioning treatments.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your hair:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle wet hair.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair too often, as it can cause breakage.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>1. Can I still wear long hair if I have an oval face shape?</h3><p>Absolutely! Women with oval face shapes can pull off a variety of hair styles, including long hair. Just make sure to add layers and texture to the hair to prevent it from looking too heavy.</p><h3>2. What is the best hair color for women over 50 with an oval face shape?</h3><p>The best hair color for women over 50 with an oval face shape depends on your skin tone and personal style. Generally, warm, natural-looking hair colors such as caramel, honey, and chestnut are flattering for women over 50.</p><h3>3. How often should I get my hair trimmed?</h3><p>It’s recommended to get your hair trimmed every 6-8 weeks to maintain your hair style and prevent split ends.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for maintaining healthy and beautiful hair. Here are some tips for taking care of your hair:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine.</li><li>Eat a healthy and balanced diet.</li><li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</li></ul><p>With the right hair style and proper hair care, women over 50 with an oval face shape can achieve a beautiful and flattering look.
