This technique creates volume and texture at the ends of the hair.</li><li>Face-framing layers: Face-framing layers involve cutting the hair around the face at different lengths to create a flattering frame for your features.</li></ul><!--Step by Step Guide--><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you're ready to give layering a try, here is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the perfect layered look:</p><ol><li>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are designed for thin fine hair.
