Do you find yourself worrying if you are starting to go bald? If so, you are not alone. Balding is a common concern among teenagers, and it can be a source of embarrassment and self-consciousness.

These treatments include minoxidil, finasteride, and hair transplant surgery.</p><h3>Can Balding be Caused by Stress?</h3><p>Stress can contribute to hair loss, but it is not the sole cause of balding. Other factors, such as genetics and hormone levels, also play a role in balding.</p><h3>Can Women Experience Balding?</h3><p>Yes, women can experience balding. While balding is more common in men, women can also be affected by the condition due to hormonal imbalances or genetic factors.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for maintaining healthy hair and preventing hair loss.
