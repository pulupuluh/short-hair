Other causes of hair loss include alopecia areata, thyroid disorders, and autoimmune diseases.</p><h2 id="balding">What is Balding?</h2><p>Balding is a condition where hair follicles shrink, leading to thinning hair and eventual hair loss.

Balding can occur in both men and women, but it is more common in men.</p><h2 id="types">Types of Balding</h2><p>There are several types of balding, including:</p><ul><li>Male pattern baldness: This is the most common type of balding in men, and it typically starts with a receding hairline and thinning at the crown of the head.</li><li>Female pattern baldness: This is the most common type of balding in women, and it typically results in thinning hair all over the scalp.</li><li>Alopecia areata: This is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp and other parts of the body.</li><li>Scarring alopecia: This is a type of alopecia that causes permanent hair loss due to scarring of the hair follicles.</li></ul><h2 id="signs">Signs of Balding</h2><p>The signs of balding can vary depending on the type of balding you are experiencing.
