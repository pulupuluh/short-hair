Here are some things you can do to make your relaxed hair grow longer:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy diet: Your hair needs nutrients to grow, so make sure you are eating a balanced diet with plenty of protein, vitamins, and minerals.</li><li>Moisturize regularly: Relaxed hair can be dry and prone to breakage, so it is important to moisturize regularly. Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and apply a leave-in conditioner or oil to your hair daily.</li><li>Avoid heat: Heat styling tools can damage your hair and cause breakage. If you must use heat, use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature low.</li><li>Protect your hair at night: Sleeping with a satin or silk scarf or pillowcase can help prevent breakage and keep your hair moisturized.</li><li>Trim regularly: Trimming your hair every 8-12 weeks can help prevent split ends and breakage.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make your relaxed hair grow longer:</p><ol><li>Start with a healthy scalp: Your scalp is the foundation of healthy hair growth, so make sure to keep it clean and moisturized. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner, and avoid over-washing.</li><li>Moisturize regularly: As mentioned earlier, relaxed hair can be dry and prone to breakage, so it is important to moisturize regularly.
