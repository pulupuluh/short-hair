It tends to be very fragile and can be difficult to comb or style.</li><li><strong>Type 3:</strong> This hair type has a looser curl pattern and is easier to manage than Type 4 hair. It can be styled in a variety of ways, including twists, braids, and wash-and-gos.</li><li><strong>Type 2:</strong> This hair type is straight or wavy and is the least common among African Americans.
