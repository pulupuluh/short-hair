Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Contouring:</h3><p>Contouring is the process of creating shadows on your face to make it appear more defined. To make your face look rounder, you can use a bronzer or contour powder to create shadows on the sides of your face. Apply the powder along your hairline, temples, and under your cheekbones, blending it in well.</p><h3>2. Blush:</h3><p>Blush can add a pop of color to your cheeks and help to round out your face. Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks, blending it upwards towards your temples. Choose a warm, rosy color that complements your complexion.</p><h3>3. Highlighting:</h3><p>Highlighting is the process of adding light to your face to make it appear more defined. To make your face look rounder, apply a highlighter to the center of your forehead, down the bridge of your nose, and on your chin.</p><h3>4. Eye Makeup:</h3><p>Play up your eyes to draw attention away from angular features. Use eyeliner to create a cat-eye or winged look, and add mascara to make your eyelashes look longer and fuller.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide:</h2><p>Now that you know some makeup tricks, here is a step-by-step guide to making your face look round:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Skin</h3><p>Start by washing your face and applying a moisturizer.
