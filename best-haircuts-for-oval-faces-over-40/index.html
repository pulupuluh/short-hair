It is versatile and can pull off many different haircuts and styles. However, as we age, our hair may thin and lose its luster. That's why it's important to find a haircut that flatters our face shape and adds volume to our hair. In this article, we will provide you with the best haircuts for oval faces over 40 to help you look and feel your best.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>When choosing a haircut, it's important to consider your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle. Oval faces are longer than they are wide, with a rounded jawline and high cheekbones. The best haircuts for oval faces over 40 are those that highlight your best features while adding volume and texture to your hair. Here are some tips on how to choose the perfect haircut:</p><h3>1. Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, oval faces are longer than they are wide. If you have an oval face shape, you can pull off many different haircuts and styles. You can go short or long, curly or straight. However, it's best to avoid haircuts that add length to your face, such as a long straight bob.</p><h3>2. Think About Your Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture will also play a role in choosing the perfect haircut.

Consider Your Lifestyle</h3><p>Lastly, consider your lifestyle when choosing a haircut. If you're a busy mom or have a hectic work schedule, you may want to opt for a low-maintenance haircut that doesn't require a lot of styling.
