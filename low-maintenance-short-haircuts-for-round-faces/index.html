Luckily, there are plenty of stylish and easy-to-maintain options available. In this article, we'll explore some of the best short haircuts for round faces that require minimal styling and upkeep.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round face is typically characterized by full cheeks, a rounded chin, and a wide forehead. If you have a round face, you'll want to choose a haircut that elongates your features and creates the illusion of a more oval-shaped face. Short haircuts can be a great option, as they can help to streamline your features and draw attention to your best assets.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>When choosing a short haircut for a round face, it's important to consider your hair texture, as well as your face shape. Some of the best options for low maintenance short haircuts for round faces include:</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a short, cropped haircut that can be customized to suit a range of face shapes. For round faces, a pixie cut with longer layers on top can help to elongate your features and create the illusion of a more oval-shaped face. This style requires minimal styling, making it a great option for those who are short on time.</p><h3>Bob Cut</h3><p>A bob cut is a classic short haircut that can be tailored to suit a variety of face shapes. For round faces, a bob cut with longer layers on the sides can help to balance out your features and create a more elongated look. This style can be worn straight or with a slight wave, and requires minimal styling to maintain.</p><h3>Layered Cut</h3><p>A layered cut is a versatile short haircut that can be customized to suit a range of face shapes. For round faces, a layered cut with longer layers on top can help to elongate your features and draw attention to your eyes and cheekbones. This style requires minimal styling, making it a great option for those who are short on time.</p><h2>Step-by-Step</h2><p>Once you've chosen a low maintenance short haircut for your round face, it's important to know how to style and maintain it. Here are some step-by-step tips for keeping your short haircut looking fresh and stylish:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, towel-dried hair</h3><p>Before styling your short haircut, make sure your hair is clean and towel-dried. This will make it easier to work with and help your styling products to adhere better.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a styling product</h3><p>Depending on your hair type and the style you're going for, you may want to apply a styling product to your hair. This could be a mousse, a gel, or a styling cream. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the roots and ends.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow dry your hair</h3><p>Using a blow dryer and a round brush, blow dry your hair in the direction you want it to go. If you have a pixie cut, you may want to use your fingers to create texture and volume. If you have a bob cut, you may want to use a flat iron to smooth out any kinks or waves.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with a styling spray</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, finish with a styling spray to lock in your style and add shine. This could be a hairspray, a texturizing spray, or a shine spray.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for maintaining your low maintenance short haircut:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to keep your haircut looking fresh and healthy</li><li>Invest in a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair looking its best</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find the ones that work best for your hair type and style</li><li>Consider adding highlights or lowlights to your hair to create dimension and depth</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best short haircut for a round face?</h3><p>The best short haircut for a round face depends on your hair texture and personal style.
