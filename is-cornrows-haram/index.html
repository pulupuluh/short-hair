The truth is, there is no straightforward answer to this question, as it depends on various factors. In this article, we will explore the Islamic perspective on cornrows, how to make them, and hair care tips for maintaining them.</p><h2> Table of Content </h2><p>1. What are Cornrows?</p><p>2. The Islamic Perspective on Cornrows</p><p>3. How to Make Cornrows?</p><p>4. Tips for Making Cornrows</p><p>5. Hair Care Tips for Cornrows</p><p>6. Frequently Asked Questions about Cornrows</p><h2> What are Cornrows? </h2><p>Cornrows are a traditional African hairstyle that involves braiding the hair close to the scalp, usually in straight lines or intricate patterns. They are popular among people of all ages and genders and can be worn for different occasions, from casual to formal.</p><h2> The Islamic Perspective on Cornrows </h2><p>There is no clear-cut answer to whether cornrows are haram or not. The main issue with cornrows is that they require hair extensions or synthetic hair, which some scholars consider haram. They argue that adding false hair to one's natural hair is imitating non-Muslims and goes against the teachings of Islam.</p><p>However, other scholars argue that as long as the hair extensions are made of natural materials, such as human hair or wool, and not from haram sources, such as pigs or dogs, then they are permissible to use. They also point out that wearing wigs or hairpieces is allowed in Islam, as long as they do not lead to arrogance or vanity.</p><h2> How to Make Cornrows? </h2><p>Making cornrows can be challenging, especially if you are doing it for the first time. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make cornrows:</p><h3> Step 1: Prepare the Hair </h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair, then detangle it using a wide-tooth comb or brush. Apply some hair oil or leave-in conditioner to make it more manageable.</p><h3> Step 2: Part the Hair </h3><p>Using a rat-tail comb, part your hair into sections according to the desired pattern. You can make straight parts or curved ones, depending on your preference.</p><h3> Step 3: Start Braiding </h3><p>Take a small section of hair from the first parting and divide it into three equal strands. Cross the right strand over the middle one, then the left strand over the new middle one. Add some hair from the parted section to the right and left strands, then repeat the process until you reach the end of the section.</p><h3> Step 4: Repeat </h3><p>Continue braiding the rest of the sections until you finish the entire head. You can add some hair extensions to make the braids longer or thicker, but make sure they are made of natural materials and not from haram sources.</p><h2> Tips for Making Cornrows </h2><p>Here are some tips that can help you make perfect cornrows:</p><ul><li>Start with clean and detangled hair</li><li>Use hair oil or leave-in conditioner to make the hair more manageable</li><li>Make neat and equal parts using a rat-tail comb</li><li>Take your time and be patient</li><li>Practice makes perfect, so don't give up if you make mistakes at first</li></ul><h2> Hair Care Tips for Cornrows </h2><p>Caring for cornrows is essential to maintain their neatness and longevity. Here are some hair care tips for cornrows:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every two weeks using a sulfate-free shampoo and lukewarm water</li><li>Apply some leave-in conditioner or hair oil to keep the hair moisturized</li><li>Avoid using heavy oils or greases that can clog the scalp and cause dandruff</li><li>Cover your hair with a satin scarf or bonnet at night to prevent frizz and breakage</li><li>Don't leave the cornrows in for too long, as it can cause tension and damage to the hairline</li></ul><h2> Frequently Asked Questions about Cornrows </h2><p>Here are some commonly asked questions about cornrows:</p><h3> Are cornrows only for women? </h3><p>No, cornrows can be worn by people of all genders, including men and children.</p><h3> Can I make cornrows on short hair? </h3><p>Yes, you can make cornrows on short hair, but you might need to use hair extensions to make them longer.</p><h3> How long do cornrows last? </h3><p>Cornrows can last up to six weeks, depending on how well you take care of them.</p><h3> Can I swim with cornrows? </h3><p>Avoid swimming with cornrows, as chlorine and saltwater can damage the hair extensions and cause tangling.</p><p> In conclusion, cornrows are not haram by default, but the use of hair extensions made from haram sources is. As long as you use natural hair extensions and take good care of your hair, you can enjoy the beauty and versatility of cornrows. </p></article>
