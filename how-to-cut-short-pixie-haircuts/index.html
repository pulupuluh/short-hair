In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to cut short pixie haircuts and give you tips on how to care for your new 'do.</p><h2>How to Cut Short Pixie Haircuts</h2><p>Before we begin, let's gather the tools you'll need for this haircut:</p><ul><li>Sharp scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Hair clips</li><li>Trimming shears (optional)</li></ul><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly before beginning the haircut. This will help you see the natural texture and shape of your hair, making it easier to cut.</p><h3>Step 2: Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using hair clips. Start by sectioning the top layer of hair from the bottom layer. Then, separate the hair at the crown of your head and clip it up. This will be the last section you cut as it will determine the overall length of your pixie cut.</p><h3>Step 3: Start cutting</h3><p>Begin cutting the bottom layer of your hair. Take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your index and middle fingers and begin cutting in a straight line. Continue cutting small sections of hair until the entire bottom layer is complete.</p><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519681393784-d120267933ba?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MjB8fHBpeGllJTIwY3V0fGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" alt="Short Pixie Cut" /></p><h3>Step 4: Cut the sides</h3><p>Move on to the side sections of your hair. Take a small section of hair from the side and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut in a diagonal line towards the back of your head. Repeat this process until both sides are complete.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the top layer</h3><p>Unclip the crown section of your hair and begin cutting it to your desired length. This will be the longest section of your pixie cut. Comb the hair straight up and hold it between your fingers. Cut in a straight line and continue until the entire section is complete.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for balance</h3><p>Once you've completed the haircut, check for balance by comparing both sides of your hair. Make any necessary adjustments to even out the length.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Short Pixie Haircuts</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when cutting short pixie haircuts:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer length and gradually cut shorter if you're unsure about the length.</li><li>Use trimming shears to add texture and movement to your pixie cut.</li><li>Don't cut your hair when it's wet as it will shrink when it dries.</li><li>Choose a style that complements your face shape.</li></ul><h2>FAQs About Cutting Short Pixie Haircuts</h2><h3>Q: Can I cut my own hair if I'm not a professional?</h3><p>A: Yes, with the right tools and techniques, you can cut your own hair.
