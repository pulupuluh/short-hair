Comb through your hair to ensure it's smooth and ready to cut.</p><h3>Step 2: Section your hair</h3><p>Using your comb, section your hair into two parts: top and bottom. Secure the top section with a clip to keep it out of the way.</p><h3>Step 3: Determine the length of your layer</h3><p>Decide where you want your layer to start. This can be at the jawline, cheekbones, or any other point you prefer. Use your comb to create a straight part where you want your layer to begin.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut your layer</h3><p>Using your hair cutting scissors, cut a straight line along the part you created in Step 3. Be sure to cut at a slight angle, as this will help to create a more natural look.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend your layer</h3><p>Using your scissors, create small vertical cuts along the bottom of your layer to blend it with the rest of your hair. This will help to create a more natural look and prevent any harsh lines.</p><h3>Step 6: Repeat on the other side</h3><p>Release the top section of your hair and repeat Steps 3-5 on the other side. Make sure your layers are even and that they blend well together.</p><h2 id="section3">Tips for Cutting Layers at Home</h2><p>Cutting your own hair can be tricky, so here are a few tips to help you achieve the best results:</p><ul><li>Start with small cuts and work your way up.
