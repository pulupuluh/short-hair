If you've decided to cut bangs, you need to know how to do it properly to avoid ruining your natural curls. In this article, we will show you how to cut natural curly hair bangs step-by-step.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Cut Natural Curly Hair Bangs</h3><p>Cutting natural curly hair bangs is not as simple as just cutting straight hair. The curls can bounce up after drying, and if you cut too much, you may end up with too-short bangs. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by washing your hair and let it air dry. Do not use a hairdryer or straightener, as you want to see the natural shape and texture of your curls.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Comb your hair to detangle it and make sure it's dry. Use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers to separate the front section of your hair that you want to cut for bangs. Make sure it's not too thick, as you don't want to cut too much hair at once.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold the hair section between your fingers and start cutting. Use a pair of sharp scissors and cut a little bit at a time. Remember that you can always cut more, but you can't add the hair back once it's cut. Cut your bangs at an angle for a soft, natural look.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check your progress as you go. Release the section and let it bounce up to see how it looks. If you're not happy with the length, continue cutting a little bit more until you reach the desired length.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you're happy with the length, use your fingers to scrunch up the curls and create more volume. You can also use a styling cream or gel to define your curls and keep them in place.</p><h3 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Natural Curly Hair Bangs</h3><p>Here are some tips to help you cut natural curly hair bangs:</p><ul><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid damaging your hair.</li><li>Cut a little bit at a time, as curly hair tends to bounce up after drying.</li><li>Don't cut your hair when it's wet, as it can stretch out and look longer than it actually is.</li><li>If you're not confident about cutting your hair, go to a professional hairdresser.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p><strong>Q: Can I cut my curly hair when it's wet?</strong></p><p>A: No, it's not recommended to cut your curly hair when it's wet, as it can stretch out and look longer than it actually is.
