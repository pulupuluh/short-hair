You'll need:</p><ul><li>Clippers</li><li>Guard sizes 1-4</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Clipper oil</li><li>Barber cape or towel</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Section the Hair</h3><p>Start by sectioning the hair. Use the comb to part the hair from one ear to the other, creating a straight line in the back. Clip the top section of the hair up and out of the way.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose the Guard Size</h3><p>Choose the guard size you want to start with. For a low fade, start with a size 4 guard. For a high fade, start with a size 2 guard.</p><h3>Step 4: Begin Fading</h3><p>Start at the bottom of the hairline and work your way up. Use the clippers to create a line around the head, following the natural curve of the hairline. Use the chosen guard size to make the line. Make sure to keep the clippers level and use a light touch.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Switch to a lower guard size (e.g. from 4 to 3) and blend the hair above the first line. Use an upward motion to create a fade. Repeat with each guard size until you reach the desired length.</p><h3>Step 6: Cut the Top Section</h3><p>Remove the clip and cut the top section using scissors. Use the comb to lift the hair and cut to the desired length. Blend the sides and the top using scissors or clippers, depending on the desired look.</p><h3>Step 7: Clean Up</h3><p>Clean up the hairline and any stray hairs. Use the clippers without a guard to create a clean line around the neck and ears. Use the scissors to trim any stray hairs.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Fading Men's Hair</h2><ul><li>Take your time.

Generally, it's recommended to get a haircut every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and length.</p><h3>Q: How do I keep my hair healthy?</h3><p>A: To keep your hair healthy, make sure to wash it regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Avoid using hot tools like hair dryers and straighteners, and protect your hair from the sun and chlorine. Eat a healthy diet and stay hydrated to promote healthy hair growth.</p><h3>Q: How do I choose the right hairstyle?</h3><p>A: Consider your face shape, hair type, and lifestyle when choosing a hairstyle. Ask your hairstylist for recommendations based on your preferences and needs.</p><p>By following these steps and tips, you can learn how to fade men's hair for beginners.
