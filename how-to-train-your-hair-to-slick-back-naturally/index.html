It's not something that can be achieved overnight, but with practice, you can train your hair to stay in place without any products. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>The first step to training your hair is to start with clean hair. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup or excess oil. This will help your hair to stay in place without any resistance.</p><h3>Step 2: Brush Your Hair Back</h3><p>While your hair is still wet, use a wide-tooth comb or a boar bristle brush to brush your hair back. Start from the front and work your way to the back. This will help to train your hair to stay in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Heat</h3><p>Use a blow dryer to apply heat to your hair while brushing it back. This will help to set the shape and encourage your hair to stay in place. Be sure to use a low heat setting to avoid damaging your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a Hair Tie</h3><p>If your hair is long enough, use a hair tie to secure it in a low ponytail at the nape of your neck. This will help to train your hair to stay in place and prevent it from falling forward.</p><h3>Step 5: Repeat Daily</h3><p>Repeat these steps daily until your hair starts to stay in place naturally. Be patient and consistent, and you'll see results in no time.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're still unsure about how to train your hair to slick back naturally, here's a step-by-step guide to help you:</p><ol><li>Start with clean hair.</li><li>Brush your hair back while it's still wet.</li><li>Apply heat with a blow dryer while brushing your hair back.</li><li>Use a hair tie to secure your hair in a low ponytail.</li><li>Repeat daily until your hair stays in place naturally.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Training Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you train your hair to slick back naturally:</p><ul><li>Be patient and consistent.</li><li>Use a clarifying shampoo to remove product buildup.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or a boar bristle brush to brush your hair back.</li><li>Use a blow dryer on a low heat setting to set the shape.</li><li>Use a hair tie to secure your hair in a low ponytail to train it to stay in place.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take to train your hair to slick back naturally?</h3><p>It can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to train your hair to slick back naturally.
