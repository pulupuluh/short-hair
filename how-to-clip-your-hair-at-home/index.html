You’ll need a pair of hair clippers, scissors, a comb, and a mirror. You may also want to have a towel to cover your shoulders and catch any hair that falls.</p><p>Now, let’s get into the steps:</p><h3>1. Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>It’s best to start with clean, dry hair. This will help you see the length and texture of your hair more clearly.</p><h3>2. Decide on the length</h3><p>Think about what length you want your hair to be. You may want to start with a longer guard on your clippers and work your way down if you’re not sure.</p><h3>3. Choose a guard</h3><p>Attach the guard to your clippers. The higher the number on the guard, the longer the hair will be. For example, a #4 guard will leave your hair 1/2 inch long.</p><h3>4. Start at the bottom</h3><p>Begin at the nape of your neck and work your way up. Use the clippers in a sweeping motion, going against the direction of hair growth. Be careful around your ears and hairline.</p><h3>5. Blend the sides and top</h3><p>Once you’ve finished the back, use the same guard on the sides and top of your head. Start at the bottom and work your way up, blending the hair as you go.</p><h3>6. Use scissors for the top</h3><p>If you want to leave the top of your hair longer, use scissors to trim it. Start by combing your hair straight up and cutting small sections at a time.</p><h3>7. Check for any missed spots</h3><p>Use a mirror to check for any spots you may have missed. Touch up as needed.</p><h3>8. Clean up</h3><p>Use a brush or towel to remove any loose hair from your shoulders and neck. Rinse your clippers and scissors and let them dry.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a summary of the steps:</p><ol><li>Wash and dry your hair</li><li>Decide on the length</li><li>Choose a guard</li><li>Start at the bottom</li><li>Blend the sides and top</li><li>Use scissors for the top</li><li>Check for any missed spots</li><li>Clean up</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down if you’re not sure</li><li>Go slow and steady</li><li>Be careful around your ears and hairline</li><li>Use scissors for the top if you want to leave it longer</li><li>Check for any missed spots with a mirror</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Can I clip my hair wet?</h3><p>No, it’s best to clip your hair dry.
