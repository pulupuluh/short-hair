This hair type can be challenging to style because it tends to be frizzy and difficult to manage. However, with the right haircut and styling techniques, you can create a variety of hairstyles that showcase your curls.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step in styling medium length curly hair is to find a haircut that works with your natural texture. Layers are a great option for curly hair because they help to define the curls and reduce frizz. When styling, it's important to use products specifically designed for curly hair.

Leave the rest of your hair down to showcase your curls.</p><h3>3. Messy Bun</h3><p>To create a messy bun, pull your hair back into a low ponytail. Twist the ponytail around itself to create a bun, securing with bobby pins. Pull a few pieces of hair out around your face for a soft, romantic look.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when styling medium length curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair, rather than a brush, which can cause frizz.</li><li>Avoid using heat tools like flat irons and curling irons, which can damage your hair and cause frizz.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair every day, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils and cause dryness.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner to help hydrate and define your curls.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best haircut for medium length curly hair?</h3><p>The best haircut for medium length curly hair is one with layers, which help to define the curls and reduce frizz.
