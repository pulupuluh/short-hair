However, with the right technique and products, you too can achieve a sleek and stylish look. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to slick back short hair and provide some tips and tricks along the way.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The slicked back hairstyle is a classic look that has been popular for decades. It involves combing the hair back away from the face and creating a smooth, sleek finish. This style works well for both men and women and can be adapted to suit different hair lengths and textures.</p><h2>How to Slick Back Short Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>The first step to achieving a slicked back look is to start with clean hair. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup or oils that may weigh down your hair. Rinse thoroughly and allow your hair to air dry or blow dry until it is completely dry.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your hair to help hold the style in place. A pomade or gel works well for this style. Start with a small amount and work it through your hair, focusing on the roots and the crown of your head. Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb Your Hair Back</h3><p>Using a fine-toothed comb, start at the front of your hairline and comb your hair back away from your face. Continue combing until all the hair is smoothed back and there are no bumps or flyaways.</p><h3>Step 4: Smooth and Shape</h3><p>Use your hands to smooth and shape your hair into the desired style. You can create a slicked back look that is either straight back or with a slight part. Use your fingers to create a natural-looking finish and ensure that the style is even on both sides.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>To ensure that your style stays in place all day, finish with a light mist of hairspray. Hold the can about 10 inches away from your head and spray lightly all over your hair. Avoid using too much hairspray as this can make your hair look stiff and unnatural.</p><h2>Tips for Slicking Back Short Hair</h2><h3>Use the Right Products</h3><p>Choosing the right products is key to achieving a slicked back look. Look for a pomade or gel that is specifically designed for short hair. These products will provide the hold you need without weighing down your hair or making it look greasy.</p><h3>Experiment with Different Styles</h3><p>There are many different variations of the slicked back look, so don't be afraid to experiment with different styles. You can try a side part, a quiff, or a messy slicked back style for a more relaxed look.</p><h3>Don't Overdo It</h3><p>Remember that less is more when it comes to styling products. Start with a small amount and work your way up as needed. Overdoing it with product can make your hair look greasy or stiff, so be sure to use just enough to achieve the desired hold.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I Slick Back Short Hair with Bangs?</h3><p>Absolutely! If you have bangs, you can slick them back with the rest of your hair for a sleek and polished look. Use a small amount of product and a fine-toothed comb to smooth your bangs back and blend them in with the rest of your hair.</p><h3>Can I Slick Back Short Curly Hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can slick back short curly hair. However, you may need to use more product to achieve the desired hold. Look for a styling product that is specifically designed for curly hair and use a comb to smooth your curls back away from your face.</p><h2>Hair Care for Slicked Back Hair</h2><h3>Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>To keep your hair looking its best, it's important to wash it regularly. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup or oils that may weigh down your hair.</p><h3>Avoid Overusing Styling Products</h3><p>While styling products can help you achieve a sleek look, overusing them can make your hair look greasy or stiff. Use just enough product to achieve the desired hold and avoid using too much.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair from Heat Damage</h3><p>If you use hot styling tools like a flat iron or curling iron, be sure to use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage to your hair. Avoid using these tools too often and allow your hair to air dry whenever possible.</p><p>With these tips and tricks, you can achieve a sleek and stylish slicked back look, even with short hair. Remember to choose the right products, experiment with different styles, and take care of your hair to keep it looking its best.</p></article>
