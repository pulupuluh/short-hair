This is because hormones can affect the growth cycle of hair follicles. For example, during menopause, the decrease in estrogen levels can lead to hair loss or thinning. Similarly, hormonal changes during pregnancy or after giving birth can also cause hair to thin. </p><p>If you suspect that hormonal changes are causing your hair thinning, it is best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.</p><h2 id="genetics">Genetics</h2><p>If hair thinning runs in your family, genetics may be the cause of your hair thinning on the side of your head. This type of hair loss is known as androgenetic alopecia and is more common in men than women. Androgenetic alopecia is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors and can be treated with medications or hair transplant surgery.</p><h2 id="hairstyles">Hairstyles</h2><p>Wearing tight hairstyles, such as braids, buns, or ponytails, can cause hair to thin on the side of the head. This is because the constant pulling on the hair follicles can cause them to become damaged over time.

These conditions affect the body's ability to produce healthy hair follicles, leading to hair loss or thinning.
