The Half-Up, Half-Down Style</h3><p>This is a classic style that looks great on all hair types. Start by sectioning off the top half of your hair and securing it with a hair tie. You can leave the bottom half of your hair down or create loose waves with a curling iron or straightener.</p><h3>2. The Messy Bun</h3><p>The messy bun is a go-to style for lazy days or when you're short on time. Start by pulling your hair back into a ponytail and securing it with a hair tie. Twist your hair around the hair tie and secure it in place with bobby pins.</p><h3>3. The French Twist</h3><p>This elegant style is perfect for a night out or a special occasion. Start by pulling your hair back into a low ponytail, leaving some hair out at the front. Twist the ponytail upwards and tuck it under itself at the nape of your neck. Secure the twist in place with bobby pins and tease the hair at the front for added volume.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you have an idea of the different styles you can create, let's go through a step-by-step guide on how to clip your hair up.</p><h3>1.
