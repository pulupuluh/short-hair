Use your fingers to hold the hair at the desired length, then snip off the excess with sharp scissors. Repeat on the other side.</li><li>Work your way up the head, taking small sections of hair and cutting them to the desired length.

However, if you’re not confident in your skills, it’s always best to seek professional help.</p><h3>What type of scissors should I use to cut thick hair?</h3><p>It’s important to use sharp, high-quality scissors when cutting thick hair.

As a general rule, it’s best to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain its health and prevent split ends.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Thick Hair</h2><p>Thick hair requires special care to keep it looking healthy and shiny.
