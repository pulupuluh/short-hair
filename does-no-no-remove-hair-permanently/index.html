It is also recommended to use a moisturizer after each treatment to soothe the skin. Additionally, it is important to be patient when using this product, as it may take several weeks to see significant results.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Does No No remove hair permanently?</h3><p>A: While the No No Hair Removal Device can lead to a reduction in hair growth over time, it does not remove hair permanently. </p><h3>Q: Is the No No Hair Removal Device safe to use?</h3><p>A: Yes, the No No Hair Removal Device is safe to use.
