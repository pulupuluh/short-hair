Make sure to pay close attention to the instructions and take your time. It's always better to go slowly and make small adjustments as you go, rather than rushing and making a mistake. </p><h2> Step-by-Step </h2><p> Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide to trimming your hair with scissors using YouTube tutorials: </p><h3> Step 1: Wash and dry your hair </h3><p> Before you start trimming, make sure your hair is clean and dry.
