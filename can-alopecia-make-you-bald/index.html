Some of these include: </p><ul><li> Corticosteroids </li><li> Topical immunotherapy </li><li> Minoxidil </li><li> Hair transplant surgery </li><li> Wearing wigs or hairpieces </li></ul><h3> Hair Care Tips for People with Alopecia </h3><p> If you have alopecia, it's important to take care of your hair to prevent further hair loss.

If you have a family history of the condition, you may be more likely to develop it yourself. </p><h3> Can alopecia be cured? </h3><p> There is currently no cure for alopecia, but there are treatments available to manage the condition and reduce hair loss. </p><h3> Does alopecia only affect the scalp? </h3><p> No, alopecia can affect other parts of the body besides the scalp, such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard area. </p><h2> In Conclusion </h2><p> Alopecia is a common hair loss condition that can make you bald.
