Here are a few exercises to try:</p><h3>Cheek Puff</h3><p>Take a deep breath and puff your cheeks out. Hold for a few seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times.</p><h3>Jaw Release</h3><p>Open your mouth wide, then move your jaw up and down like you're chewing gum. Repeat 10 times.</p><h3>Tongue Stretch</h3><p>Stick your tongue out as far as possible, then hold for a few seconds. Repeat 10 times.</p><h2 id="hairstyles">Hairstyles</h2><p>The right hairstyle can make a big difference in how round your face appears.
