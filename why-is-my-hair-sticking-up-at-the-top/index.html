There are several reasons why this might be happening. One of the most common reasons is that your hair is simply too dry.

One of the most important things is to make sure that your hair is properly moisturized. This means using a good quality conditioner after shampooing, and applying a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to the ends of your hair. You can also use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to give your hair an extra boost of moisture.</p><p>Another thing you can do is to use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. These products will help to add body and volume to your hair, making it less likely to fall flat at the roots.
