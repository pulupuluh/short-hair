Square faces are characterized by a strong jawline, broad forehead, and cheekbones that are almost as wide as the forehead. Long hairstyles can help soften the angles of a square face, while also adding volume and movement to the hair. In this article, we will explore some of the best long hairstyles for square faces over 60.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Long hairstyles are a great choice for women over 60 with square faces because they can help balance out the proportions of the face. Square faces tend to have a strong jawline, so adding length to the hair can soften the angles and create a more feminine look. Long hairstyles can also add volume to the hair, which can be especially beneficial for women with thinning hair.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you are considering a long hairstyle for your square face, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, consider the texture of your hair. If you have fine hair, a layered cut can add volume and movement. If you have thick hair, a blunt cut can help control the volume. Second, consider your lifestyle. If you are active and prefer low-maintenance hairstyles, a simple layered cut may be best. If you enjoy styling your hair, a more complex cut with layers and angles may be more suitable.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Step 1: Consult with a hairstylist who has experience working with square face shapes and women over 60.</p><p>Step 2: Consider the texture and thickness of your hair, as well as your lifestyle and preferred level of maintenance.</p><p>Step 3: Choose a long hairstyle that suits your face shape and personal style.</p><p>Step 4: Work with your hairstylist to achieve the desired cut and style.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when choosing a long hairstyle for a square face over 60:</p><ul><li>Consider adding layers or angles to create movement and soften the angles of the face.</li><li>A side-swept fringe can help balance out the proportions of the face.</li><li>A long bob or lob can be a great option for women who want a shorter hairstyle without sacrificing length.</li><li>A center part can elongate the face, while a side part can create volume and balance.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Q: What hairstyles should I avoid if I have a square face over 60?</p><p>A: Avoid hairstyles that emphasize the squareness of the face, such as blunt bobs or severe, straight-across bangs.</p><p>Q: Can I still wear my hair long if I have thinning hair?</p><p>A: Yes! Adding layers to a long hairstyle can create the illusion of volume and movement, even if the hair is thinning.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Long hair requires regular maintenance to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some hair care tips for women with long hair:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons too frequently, as this can damage the hair.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray when using heat styling tools.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip the natural oils from the scalp and lead to dryness and breakage.</li><li>Consider using a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair soft and healthy.</li></ul><p>Long hairstyles can be a great choice for women over 60 with square face shapes. By choosing the right cut and style, you can create a look that flatters your face shape and suits your personal style. Remember to consult with a hairstylist who has experience working with women over 60 and square face shapes, and to keep up with regular hair care to keep your long locks looking their best.</p></article>
