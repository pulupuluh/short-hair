Doing this twice a week can help to control dandruff effectively.</p><h3>3. Fenugreek Seeds</h3><p>Fenugreek seeds are rich in protein and nicotinic acid, which can help to strengthen hair follicles and prevent hair fall. Soak 2-3 tablespoons of fenugreek seeds overnight and grind them into a paste the next morning. Apply the paste to your scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes before washing it off with a mild shampoo. Doing this once a week can help to control hair fall naturally.</p><h3>4. Tea Tree Oil</h3><p>Tea tree oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties that can help to prevent dandruff and soothe an itchy scalp.
