You can use coconut oil, almond oil, or olive oil for the massage. Simply warm the oil and massage it into your scalp for a few minutes. Leave it on for at least an hour before washing it off with a mild shampoo. Doing this once a week can make a huge difference.</p><h3>2. Aloe Vera</h3><p>Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that can help to soothe an irritated scalp and prevent dandruff. You can apply fresh aloe vera gel directly to your scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes before washing it off with a mild shampoo. Doing this twice a week can help to control dandruff effectively.</p><h3>3. Fenugreek Seeds</h3><p>Fenugreek seeds are rich in protein and nicotinic acid, which can help to strengthen hair follicles and prevent hair fall. Soak 2-3 tablespoons of fenugreek seeds overnight and grind them into a paste the next morning. Apply the paste to your scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes before washing it off with a mild shampoo. Doing this once a week can help to control hair fall naturally.</p><h3>4. Tea Tree Oil</h3><p>Tea tree oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties that can help to prevent dandruff and soothe an itchy scalp.
