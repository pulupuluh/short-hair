Cut small sections of your hair at a time, and be careful not to cut too much. It’s always better to cut less than to cut too much.</p><h3>Step 4: Check Your Progress</h3><p>Check your progress as you go along. Use a mirror to see the back of your head and make sure that everything is even. If you notice any unevenness, go back and fix it.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>After you're done cutting your hair, style it the way you like.
