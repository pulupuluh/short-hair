You can bring in a photo of what you want or describe it to them in detail. The key to achieving a perfect fade is to have a clean and sharp line where the short hair meets the long hair. The barber will use clippers and scissors to blend the hair from the shorter sides to the longer top.</p><p>Once the fade is complete, the hair on the top can be styled in a variety of ways. You can slick it back for a classic look, or use a pomade to create a messy, textured style. The possibilities are endless, so experiment with different products and techniques to find what works best for you.</p><h2>Step By Step Guide To Styling A Fade Hairstyle Long Top</h2><p>1.
