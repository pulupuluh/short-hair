With a longer face, it's important to choose a hairstyle that adds width and volume to the sides of your head, balancing out your features. In this article, we will provide you with a comprehensive guide to the best haircuts for oblong face shape male, along with tips on how to style and care for your hair. </p><h2> How to Determine if You Have an Oblong Face Shape </h2><p> Before we dive into the haircuts, it's important to determine if you actually have an oblong face shape. This face shape is characterized by a longer and narrower shape, with a prominent forehead and chin. To determine if you have an oblong face shape, measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. If your forehead and jawline are significantly longer than your cheekbones, you likely have an oblong face shape. </p><h2> Best Haircuts for Oblong Face Shape Male </h2><h3> Short Haircuts </h3><p> Short haircuts can work well for oblong face shape male, as they add width to the sides of the head. A textured crop or buzz cut with a fade on the sides can help to balance out your features. If you prefer a longer style, a slicked-back undercut can also work well. </p><h3> Medium-Length Haircuts </h3><p> For a medium-length haircut, consider a side-swept fringe or a messy quiff. These styles add volume to the sides of the head, creating a balanced look. A layered cut with shorter sides and longer top can also work well. </p><h3> Long Haircuts </h3><p> If you prefer longer hair, consider a shaggy style with layers and texture. This will add width to the sides of your head, balancing out your features. A shoulder-length cut with layers can also work well, creating a more oval-shaped face. </p><h2> How to Style Your Hair </h2><p> Once you have chosen the right haircut for your oblong face shape, it's important to know how to style it properly. Use a lightweight styling product, such as a clay or wax, to add texture and volume to your hair. Avoid styling your hair straight back, as this can accentuate the length of your face. Instead, try a side part or a messy, textured style. </p><h2> Tips for Maintaining Your Hair </h2><p> To keep your hair looking its best, it's important to maintain it properly. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is designed for your hair type, and avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils. Visit a stylist every 4-6 weeks to keep your haircut looking fresh and to remove any split ends. </p><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> What if I have a receding hairline? </h3><p> If you have a receding hairline, it's important to choose a haircut that works with your hairline. A buzz cut or shaved head can work well, as can a short cropped cut. Avoid long hair, as this can accentuate a receding hairline. </p><h3> Can I wear a center part with an oblong face shape? </h3><p> While a center part can work for some face shapes, it's not ideal for oblong face shape male. This can accentuate the length of your face, making it appear even longer. Instead, try a side part or a messy, textured style. </p><h3> Can I wear bangs with an oblong face shape? </h3><p> Bangs can work well for oblong face shape male, as they add width to the forehead. However, it's important to choose the right type of bangs. Side-swept or choppy bangs can work well, while blunt bangs can accentuate the length of your face. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> In addition to choosing the right haircut and styling your hair properly, it's important to take care of your hair. Use a hydrating hair mask once a week to keep your hair moisturized, and avoid using hot tools, such as blow dryers and flat irons, too often. Trim your hair regularly to keep it healthy and avoid split ends. </p><p> With the right haircut and styling techniques, oblong face shape male can look their best. Use our guide to find the perfect haircut for your face shape, and follow our tips for styling and maintaining your hair. </p></article>
