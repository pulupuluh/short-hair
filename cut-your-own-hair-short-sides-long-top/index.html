Look no further than the short sides long top style! This trendy cut has been popular for years, and it's easy to see why. It's versatile, low-maintenance, and looks great on just about everyone. Plus, with a little practice, you can easily cut your own hair at home. Keep reading for our step-by-step guide on how to cut your own hair short sides long top. </p><h2> How to Cut Your Own Hair Short Sides Long Top </h2><p>Before we get started, you'll need a few tools. You'll want a pair of sharp hair-cutting scissors, a comb, and a set of hair clippers with different guards. </p><h3> Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair </h3><p>Start by washing your hair and letting it air dry. This will make it easier to see what you're doing and ensure you're cutting your hair evenly. </p><h3> Step 2: Section Your Hair </h3><p>Using your comb, divide your hair into three sections: the top, the sides, and the back. Use hair clips to secure the top section out of the way. </p><h3> Step 3: Cut the Sides </h3><p>Using your hair clippers with a guard, begin cutting the sides of your hair. Start with the longest guard and work your way down until you're happy with the length. Use the shorter guards to taper the hair around your ears and neck. </p><h3> Step 4: Cut the Top </h3><p>Once you're done with the sides, unclip the top section and comb it forward. Using your scissors, cut the hair to your desired length. You can cut straight across or use a point-cutting technique for a more textured look. </p><h3> Step 5: Blend the Top and Sides </h3><p>Using your scissors, blend the top and sides of your hair together. This will create a seamless transition between the two sections. </p><h3> Step 6: Clean Up the Neckline </h3><p>Using your clippers without a guard, clean up the hair around your neck and ears. You can also use your scissors to trim any stray hairs. </p><h3> Step 7: Style Your Hair </h3><p>Once your hair is cut, it's time to style it. You can use a styling product like pomade or wax to create a textured, messy look. </p><h2> Tips for Cutting Your Own Hair </h2><p>Here are a few tips to help you achieve the perfect short sides long top haircut: </p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down. It's always easier to take more hair off than to put it back on. </li><li>Use a mirror to check your progress from all angles. </li><li>Don't rush! Take your time and be patient. </li><li>If you're unsure about cutting your own hair, consider asking a friend to help or visiting a professional stylist. </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> How do I know what length guard to use? </h3><p>Start with a longer guard and work your way down until you're happy with the length. If you're unsure, it's always better to start longer and work your way down. </p><h3> Can I use regular scissors to cut my hair? </h3><p>We recommend using hair-cutting scissors, as they're sharper and designed specifically for cutting hair. Regular scissors can cause split ends and uneven cuts. </p><h3> How often should I cut my hair? </h3><p>It depends on how quickly your hair grows and how long you want to keep your hair short sides long top style. Generally, you'll want to trim your hair every 4-6 weeks to keep it looking fresh. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>Now that you've cut your hair, it's important to take care of it. Here are a few tips for keeping your hair healthy: </p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid drying out your hair. </li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons too often. </li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends. </li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote healthy hair growth. </li></ul><p>With these tips and our step-by-step guide, you'll be able to cut your own hair short sides long top style with ease. Give it a try and see how it looks! </p></article>
