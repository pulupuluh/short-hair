Within each hair type, there are subcategories based on the thickness and texture of your hair. Here are the general characteristics of each hair type:</p><h3>Straight Hair</h3><p>Straight hair is typically smooth and shiny. It tends to be oily and lacks volume. Straight hair is the easiest to manage and style.</p><h3>Wavy Hair</h3><p>Wavy hair is characterized by loose curls or waves. It tends to be frizzy and can have a combination of both straight and curly textures. Wavy hair is versatile and can be styled in many ways.</p><h3>Curly Hair</h3><p>Curly hair is defined by tight, spiral curls. It tends to be dry and prone to frizz. Curly hair can be challenging to manage but can also be very beautiful.</p><h3>Coily Hair</h3><p>Coily hair is the tightest curl pattern, also known as kinky or afro-textured hair. It tends to be very dry and requires a lot of moisture. Coily hair is fragile and requires gentle handling.</p><p>Now that you know the general characteristics of each hair type, you can determine which category your hair falls under.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here are the steps to determine your hair type:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Allow your hair to air dry or use a t-shirt to gently dry your hair.</li><li>Do not brush or comb your hair after washing.</li><li>Observe the natural shape of your hair:</li></ol><h3>Straight Hair</h3><p>If your hair dries straight with no visible curl pattern, you have straight hair.</p><h3>Wavy Hair</h3><p>If your hair dries with a slight "S" shape or loose waves, you have wavy hair.</p><h3>Curly Hair</h3><p>If your hair dries with a defined curl pattern, you have curly hair. The tighter the curl, the curlier your hair is.</p><h3>Coily Hair</h3><p>If your hair dries with a very tight curl pattern or zigzag shape, you have coily hair.</p><p>Remember that hair types can change over time due to hormonal changes, aging, and hair damage. It's important to re-evaluate your hair type periodically and adjust your hair care routine accordingly.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Hair Care</h2><p>Once you know your hair type, you can choose the right hair care products and styling techniques to enhance your natural curls.
