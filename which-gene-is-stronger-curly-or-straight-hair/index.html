While both hair types have their unique characteristics, understanding the biology behind each hair type can help you make informed decisions about how to care for your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Genes are the building blocks of our bodies, and they play a significant role in determining our hair type. There are two genes that determine whether hair is curly or straight – the EDAR gene and the FGFR2 gene. These genes are responsible for the shape and texture of the hair shaft.</p><p>The EDAR gene controls the thickness and density of hair follicles, while the FGFR2 gene determines the shape of the hair follicle. People with curly hair have a more oval-shaped hair follicle, while people with straight hair have a round hair follicle.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you're wondering which gene is stronger when it comes to hair type, the answer is not that simple. Both genes play a significant role in determining the shape and texture of your hair. However, there are a few things you can do to care for your hair, regardless of its type.</p><p>Firstly, it's essential to keep your hair healthy by eating a balanced diet and staying hydrated. Secondly, avoid using harsh chemicals on your hair, such as bleach or relaxers, as they can damage the hair shaft and lead to breakage.</p><p>Lastly, invest in quality hair care products that are designed for your hair type.
