One of the most common ways is through telogen effluvium, a condition that causes hair follicles to go into a resting phase. This can result in increased shedding and thinning hair.</p><p>Stress can also cause hormonal imbalances that affect hair growth. For example, stress can increase levels of the hormone cortisol, which can lead to a decrease in the production of estrogen and testosterone.
