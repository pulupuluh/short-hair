One such hairstyle that has become quite popular recently is bangs. However, if you have a square face, you might be wondering if bangs are a good idea for you or not. In this article, we will discuss the pros and cons of wearing bangs for square faces and answer some frequently asked questions related to this topic.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#pros-and-cons-of-bangs">Pros and Cons of Bangs for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-choose-bangs">How to Choose the Right Bangs for Your Square Face</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Bangs for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#tips-for-maintaining-bangs">Tips for Maintaining Bangs for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care-tips">Hair Care Tips for Square Faces</a></li></ul><h2>Pros and Cons of Bangs for Square Faces</h2><p>Bangs can be a great way to soften the angles of a square face and draw attention to the eyes. They can also add a touch of femininity to a sharp jawline. However, not all types of bangs work well with square faces. Straight, blunt bangs can make a square face look even more boxy and harsh. </p><p>On the other hand, side-swept bangs or wispy bangs can be a better fit for square faces. These styles create a diagonal line across the face, which helps to break up the square shape. Additionally, layered bangs can add texture and movement to the hair, which can also help to soften the face.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Bangs for Your Square Face</h2><p>When choosing the right type of bangs for your square face, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Consider your hair type and texture. Some types of bangs work better with certain hair types. For example, thick, straight hair can handle blunt bangs better than thin, fine hair.</li><li>Think about your lifestyle. If you are constantly on the go and don't have much time to style your hair, you may want to opt for low-maintenance bangs that don't require a lot of upkeep.</li><li>Consult with a hairstylist. A professional stylist can help you choose the right type of bangs based on your face shape, hair type, and personal style.</li></ul><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Bangs for Square Faces</h2><p>If you are confident in your hair cutting skills, you can cut your own bangs at home. Here's a step-by-step guide to cutting bangs for square faces:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.</li><li>Section off the hair that you want to cut into bangs. Use a comb to create a triangle shape that starts at the center of your hairline and extends out to your temples.</li><li>Use hair cutting scissors to trim the hair to the desired length. Remember to start with a longer length and work your way shorter, as you can always cut more off but can't add hair back.</li><li>Once you have the length you want, use the scissors to create texture and movement in the bangs. You can do this by cutting into the hair at an angle or using thinning shears.</li><li>Style the bangs as desired.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Bangs for Square Faces</h2><p>Once you have your bangs, it's important to take care of them to keep them looking great. Here are some tips for maintaining bangs for square faces:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly to prevent oil buildup on the scalp and hair.</li><li>Blow dry your bangs in the direction you want them to fall.</li><li>Use a round brush to style your bangs while blow drying for a smooth, polished look.</li><li>Use a dry shampoo to keep your bangs looking fresh between washes.</li><li>Trim your bangs every 4-6 weeks to keep them at the desired length.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What are the best types of bangs for square faces?</h3><p>The best types of bangs for square faces are side-swept or wispy bangs. These styles create a diagonal line across the face, which helps to break up the square shape.</p><h3>Can square faces wear blunt bangs?</h3><p>Square faces can wear blunt bangs, but it's not the best choice. Blunt bangs can make a square face look even more boxy and harsh. </p><h3>Do bangs make your face look rounder?</h3><p>It depends on the type of bangs you choose.
