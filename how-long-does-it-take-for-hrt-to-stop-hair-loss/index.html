This treatment can help to stop hair loss by restoring hormonal balance in the body.

As women approach menopause, the levels of estrogen in the body start to decline, leading to hair loss. HRT can help to restore the levels of estrogen in the body, which may help to prevent hair loss.</p><p>Progesterone is another hormone that can help to stop hair loss. It helps to counteract the effects of androgens, which are male hormones that can cause hair loss. Testosterone, on the other hand, can cause hair loss in both men and women.
