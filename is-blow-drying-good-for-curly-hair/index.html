The heat from the blow dryer can help to smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz, resulting in a smoother, more defined curl pattern.

It's important to use the right tools and techniques to minimize damage and achieve healthy, bouncy curls.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Blow Dry Curly Hair</h3><p>Before blow drying curly hair, it's important to prep the hair properly. Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are specifically formulated for curly hair. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair while it's wet, being careful not to pull or tug too hard. Apply a leave-in conditioner or styling product to help protect your hair from heat damage and keep it moisturized.</p><p>Next, use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer. A diffuser is a tool that disperses the airflow over a larger area, which helps to reduce frizz and maintain your curl pattern. Start by using the blow dryer on a low heat setting and low speed, using the diffuser to gently lift and scrunch your hair. As you work, gradually increase the heat and speed settings, being careful not to overdo it.
