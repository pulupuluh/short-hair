Avoid shampoos containing harsh ingredients like sulfates, which can strip curly hair of its natural oils and cause further damage.</li><li><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Look for shampoos containing active ingredients like salicylic acid or zinc pyrithione, which can help to exfoliate the scalp and reduce dandruff.

Aim to wash your hair no more than once or twice a week.</li><li><strong>Use a Clarifying Shampoo:</strong> Using a clarifying shampoo once a month can help to remove buildup from hair products and hard water, which can contribute to dandruff.</li><li><strong>Try Apple Cider Vinegar:</strong> Apple cider vinegar can help to restore the pH balance of the scalp, which can help to reduce dandruff. Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water, and use it as a final rinse after shampooing and conditioning.</li><li><strong>Avoid Heat Styling:</strong> Heat styling tools can further damage already fragile curly hair and exacerbate dandruff.
