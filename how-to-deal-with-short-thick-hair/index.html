Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and avoid over-washing your hair.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to nourish your hair and keep it soft and shiny.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools too often, as this can damage your hair and make it look dry and brittle.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your ends healthy and prevent split ends.</li></ul><p>Dealing with short thick hair can be a challenge, but with the right tools, products, and techniques, you can create a variety of stylish looks that are easy to maintain.
