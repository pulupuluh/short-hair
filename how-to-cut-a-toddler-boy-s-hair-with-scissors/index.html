You will need a pair of scissors, a comb, a spray bottle filled with water, and a towel. It is important to use scissors specifically designed for cutting hair, as they are sharper and more precise.</p><p>Next, choose a comfortable spot where your toddler can sit or stand still for the duration of the haircut. A high chair or booster seat can be a good option, as they keep your toddler in one place and at a comfortable height for you to work with.</p><p>Before you start cutting, it is important to have a clear idea of the hairstyle you want to achieve. You can reference pictures of hairstyles or consult a hairstylist for guidance. Keep in mind that toddler's hair tends to grow quickly, so a shorter hairstyle may be more practical.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h3><p>Follow these steps to cut your toddler boy's hair with scissors:</p><ol><li>Begin by wetting your toddler's hair with the spray bottle. This will make the hair easier to comb and cut.</li><li>Comb the hair in the direction it naturally falls. This will help you identify any uneven spots or knots that need to be trimmed.</li><li>Starting at the back of your toddler's head, use the scissors to trim the hair to the desired length.
