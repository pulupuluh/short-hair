It typically begins at the temples and gradually moves back, creating an "M" shape. This condition is often caused by genetics, but it can also be triggered by stress, hormonal changes, and certain medications.

However, it may have side effects, such as decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction, so talk to your doctor before taking it.</p><h3>3.
