Massage your scalp gently with your fingertips for a few minutes to stimulate blood circulation and promote hair growth.</p><h3>Step 3: Rinse Thoroughly</h3><p>Rinse your hair thoroughly with lukewarm water to remove all the shampoo from your hair and scalp.</p><h3>Step 4: Condition Your Hair</h3><p>After shampooing, apply conditioner to your hair to moisturize and nourish it.
