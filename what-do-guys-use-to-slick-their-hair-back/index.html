Slicked-back hair is the perfect option for men who want to look sharp and polished. But what do guys use to slick their hair back? In this article, we will explore the different products and techniques used to achieve this iconic hairstyle.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Slicked-back hair has been a popular hairstyle for men for decades. This style involves combing the hair back and away from the face, creating a smooth, sleek look. It can be worn with a side part or with the hair slicked straight back. This hairstyle is versatile and can be dressed up or down, making it a great option for any occasion.</p><h2>How to Slick Your Hair Back</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to slick your hair back:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or residue. Towel-dry your hair until it's damp, but not wet.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a styling product</h3><p>There are several products you can use to slick your hair back, including hair gel, pomade, and wax. Apply a small amount of the product to your hair, starting at the roots and working your way up. Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb your hair back</h3><p>Use a fine-tooth comb to comb your hair back and away from your face. Start at the hairline and work your way back, smoothing out any bumps or tangles as you go.</p><h3>Step 4: Style your hair</h3><p>Once your hair is slicked back, you can style it to your liking. You can create a side part or leave your hair slicked straight back. You can also use a hair dryer to add volume and hold to your hair.</p><h2>Tips for Slicking Your Hair Back</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect slicked-back hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use a high-quality styling product to ensure a strong hold</li><li>Start with a small amount of product and add more as needed</li><li>Use a fine-tooth comb to create a smooth, polished look</li><li>Experiment with different styles to find what works best for you</li><li>Consider getting a professional haircut to complement your slicked-back hairstyle</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What is the best product to use for slicked-back hair?</h3><p>The best product to use for slicked-back hair depends on your hair type and personal preference.

You may also want to blow-dry your hair straight before slicking it back.</p><h3>How long does the slicked-back hairstyle last?</h3><p>The slicked-back hairstyle can last all day if you use a strong-hold styling product. However, if you have fine or thin hair, the style may start to fall flat after a few hours.</p><h2>Hair Care for Slicked-Back Hair</h2><p>To keep your slicked-back hair looking its best, it's important to take good care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove buildup and residue</li><li>Use a conditioner to keep your hair healthy and hydrated</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy</li><li>Get regular haircuts to keep your hair looking neat and polished</li></ul><p>So, there you have it â everything you need to know about what guys use to slick their hair back.
