They can add volume and texture to the hair and create a more angular appearance.</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a classic short haircut that never goes out of style. It's perfect for round faces because it adds height at the crown and creates angles around the cheekbones and jawline. You can opt for a classic pixie with short layers and side-swept bangs or a more modern version with longer layers and choppy texture.</p><h3>Bob Cut</h3><p>A chin-length bob is another great option for round faces. It creates a horizontal line that elongates the face and draws attention away from the cheeks. You can choose a blunt cut or add some layers and texture for a more playful look. Consider adding side-swept bangs to create asymmetry and balance out the face shape.</p><h2 id="medium-hairstyles">Medium Hairstyles for Round Face over 60</h2><p>If you prefer a longer hairstyle, medium-length haircuts can be a great option. They offer versatility and can be styled in many different ways to suit your face shape and personal style.</p><h3>Layered Cut</h3><p>A layered cut with long, face-framing layers can create a more elongated appearance and add volume and movement to the hair. You can opt for a side-swept bang or a middle part, depending on your preference.</p><h3>Shoulder-Length Bob</h3><p>A shoulder-length bob is another great option for round faces. It creates a horizontal line that elongates the face and draws attention away from the cheeks. You can choose a blunt cut or add some layers and texture for a more playful look. Consider adding side-swept bangs to create asymmetry and balance out the face shape.</p><h2 id="long-hairstyles">Long Hairstyles for Round Face over 60</h2><p>If you're blessed with long hair, there are plenty of hairstyles that can flatter your round face shape. The key is to add layers and texture to create movement and dimension.</p><h3>Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers can create a more elongated appearance and add volume and movement to the hair. You can choose a center part or a side part, depending on your preference. Consider adding some waves or curls to create even more texture and dimension.</p><h3>Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can create asymmetry and balance out the face shape. They can be paired with any long hairstyle, from loose waves to sleek straight hair. Just make sure to keep the rest of your hair layered and textured to avoid a heavy, weighed-down look.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Round Face over 60</h2><p>Now that you've chosen the perfect hairstyle, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it looking healthy and vibrant.
