You can also opt for a slightly lighter shade, but avoid going too dark.</p><h3>Step 2: Conduct a Strand Test</h3><p>Before applying the hair dye, conduct a strand test to ensure that the color matches your roots. Apply the dye to a small section of hair and wait for the recommended time before rinsing it off. If the color matches your roots, you can proceed with the full application.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply the Hair Dye</h3><p>Follow the instructions on the hair dye box to apply the dye to your hair. Start from the roots and work your way to the tips.
