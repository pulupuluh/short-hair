Try to wash your hair every other day, or even less frequently if possible.</p><h3>2.

Try to limit your use of curling irons and straighteners, and use a heat protectant spray when you do use them.</p><h3>4.

You can also wrap your hair in a silk or satin scarf.</p><h3>4. Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry</h3><p>Brushing your hair when it's dry can cause breakage and frizz.
