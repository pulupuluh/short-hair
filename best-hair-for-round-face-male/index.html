Hairstyles that add height and volume on top and length to the sides can help balance out the proportions of a round face. Avoid hairstyles that are too short or too flat on top, as they can make the face appear even rounder.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The key to finding the best hair for round face male is to choose a cut that adds height and volume on top and creates the illusion of length on the sides. The following hairstyles are great options for round faces:</p><h3>1. Side-Parted Undercut</h3><p>The side-parted undercut is a stylish and versatile haircut that works well for round faces. The longer hair on top adds height and volume, while the shaved sides create the illusion of length. To style, apply a small amount of pomade or wax to damp hair and comb it to one side. Use a blow dryer to add volume, and finish with a light hairspray.</p><h3>2. Messy Quiff</h3><p>The messy quiff is a modern and edgy haircut that can flatter round faces. The textured, tousled hair on top adds height and volume, while the shorter sides create a more angular look. To style, apply a texturizing product to damp hair and blow-dry it with your fingers. Use a small amount of pomade or wax to create a messy, undone look.</p><h3>3. Textured Crop</h3><p>The textured crop is a low-maintenance and stylish haircut that suits round faces. The short, textured hair on top adds height and volume, while the tapered sides create a more defined jawline. To style, apply a small amount of styling cream to damp hair and comb it forward. Use your fingers to create texture, and finish with a light hairspray.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to achieve the best hair for round face male:</p><ol><li>Choose a haircut that adds height and volume on top and creates the illusion of length on the sides.</li><li>Use a texturizing or volumizing product to add volume and texture to your hair.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair using a round brush or your fingers to create volume.</li><li>Use a small amount of pomade or wax to create the desired shape and texture.</li><li>Finish with a light hairspray to hold the style in place.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when choosing the best hair for round face male:</p><ul><li>Choose a haircut that complements your face shape and features.</li><li>Ask your hairstylist for advice on the best hairstyle for your face shape.</li><li>Experiment with different hairstyles and products to find the perfect look.</li><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as it can strip it of its natural oils and make it look dull.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best haircut for a round face male?</h3><p>The best haircut for a round face male is one that adds height and volume on top and creates the illusion of length on the sides.
