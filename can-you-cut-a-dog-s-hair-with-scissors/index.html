Be sure to keep your scissors pointed away from your dog's skin to avoid accidentally cutting them. If you're unsure about how much to trim, it's always better to start with a small amount and work your way up.</p><h3>Step 4: Check Your Work</h3><p>Once you've finished trimming your dog's hair, take a step back and check your work.
