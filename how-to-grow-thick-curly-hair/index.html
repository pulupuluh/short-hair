If you have damage or split ends, trim them off before you begin.</li><li>Invest in a high-quality shampoo and conditioner designed for curly hair. Look for products that are sulfate-free and contain moisturizing ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil.</li><li>Massage your scalp regularly to stimulate blood flow and promote growth.
