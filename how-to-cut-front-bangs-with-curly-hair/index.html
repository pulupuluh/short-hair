Curly hair often has a mind of its own, and it can be difficult to get it to cooperate. If you're thinking about cutting front bangs with curly hair, you might be feeling a bit intimidated.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Make sure your hair is dry and styled the way you normally wear it. This will give you a better idea of how the bangs will look with your hair.</li><li>Consider the texture of your hair. Curly hair tends to shrink up when it dries, so your bangs may end up shorter than you intended if you cut them while your hair is wet.</li><li>Start with a small section of hair. You can always cut more if you need to, but you can't put hair back once it's cut.</li><li>Use sharp scissors. Dull scissors can damage your hair and create split ends.</li><li>Take your time. Cutting bangs can be nerve-wracking, but rushing can lead to mistakes.</li></ul><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Follow these steps to cut front bangs with curly hair:</p><ol><li>Part your hair in the middle or on the side, depending on how you normally wear it.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the front of your head. This section should be about as wide as your forehead.</li><li>Hold the section of hair between your index and middle fingers. Make sure it's taut but not too tight.</li><li>Using your other hand, hold the scissors vertically and snip into the hair. This will create a textured look.</li><li>Continue snipping into the hair until you've reached your desired length.

This will make it easier to work with.</li><li>Don't cut too much off at once. It's better to take your time and cut a little bit at a time than to make a big mistake.</li><li>If you're not sure how short to cut your bangs, start by cutting them longer than you think you want.
