Enter the messy hair trend, which has been popular for years and shows no signs of slowing down. But how can you achieve the perfect medium messy hair look?

You'll want to create a natural, undone look that gives your hair lots of movement and volume. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Start with Clean, Damp Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, then towel dry until it's slightly damp. Avoid using a hair dryer, as this can make your hair look too polished and sleek.</p><h3>2. Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Choose a styling product that works for your hair type and texture. For medium messy hair, we recommend a lightweight, matte-finish product like a texturizing paste or clay. Rub a small amount between your palms, then work it through your hair from roots to tips.</p><h3>3. Use Your Fingers to Create Texture</h3><p>With your fingers, scrunch and tousle your hair to create texture and volume. Don't worry about making it look perfect â the goal is to create a natural, messy look.</p><h3>4. Finish with Hairspray (Optional)</h3><p>If your hair tends to fall flat easily, you can finish with a light mist of hairspray to help hold the style in place. Look for a flexible hold hairspray that won't make your hair look stiff or crunchy.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know the basics of how to style medium messy hair, here's a step-by-step guide to follow:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, then towel dry until it's slightly damp.</li><li>Choose a styling product like a texturizing paste or clay, then apply a small amount to your palms.</li><li>Work the product through your hair, using your fingers to create texture and volume.</li><li>If necessary, use a blow dryer on low heat to help set the style.</li><li>Finish with a light mist of flexible hold hairspray.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Perfecting the Look</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for perfecting your medium messy hair style:</p><ul><li>Experiment with different styling products to find one that works best for your hair type and texture.</li><li>Don't be afraid to use your fingers to create texture and volume â a comb or brush will make your hair look too neat and polished.</li><li>Try adding a side part or fringe to your medium messy hair for a more personalized look.</li><li>Consider getting regular trims to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Don't overdo it with the hairspray â a little goes a long way.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Is medium messy hair suitable for all face shapes?</h3><p>Yes! Medium messy hair can work for any face shape, as long as you customize the style to suit your features. For example, if you have a round face, you might want to add height to your hair to create a more elongated look.</p><h3>Can I style medium messy hair if I have curly hair?</h3><p>Absolutely! In fact, curly hair can be perfect for a messy, textured look. Just be sure to choose a styling product that won't weigh your curls down or make them look too crunchy.</p><h3>How often should I wash my medium messy hair?</h3><p>This depends on your hair type and texture. If your hair tends to get oily easily, you may need to wash it every day or every other day. However, if your hair is dry or curly, you may be able to go longer between washes. Experiment to find a schedule that works for you.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Medium Messy Hair</h2><p>To keep your medium messy hair looking its best, it's important to take care of it properly. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that won't strip your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons or curling irons, as these can damage your hair over time.</li><li>Consider using a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair soft and healthy.</li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends and keep your hair looking neat and tidy.</li></ul><p>With these tips and techniques, you'll be able to style your medium messy hair like a pro.
