The Bible does not say that women cannot have short hair, and there is no biblical basis for this belief.</p><h3>Why Do Some People Believe that Women Should Have Long Hair?</h3><p>Some people believe that women should have long hair because of the cultural context of the time when the Bible was written. In ancient Jewish and Christian cultures, long hair was seen as a symbol of femininity and modesty.
