Curly hair tends to shrink when it dries, so you need to account for that when cutting your bangs. Here are the basic steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Section your hair</h3><p>Start by sectioning your hair. Use a comb to create a part down the middle of your head, from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Then, use clips to secure the hair on either side of your head.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on the length</h3><p>Decide on the length of your bangs. Keep in mind that curly hair tends to shrink when it dries, so you may want to cut them longer than you think you need.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the hair</h3><p>Start cutting your hair from the middle of your forehead towards the outer edges. Use scissors to cut your hair in a straight line. Make sure to cut the hair in small sections, so you can control the length and avoid cutting too much at once.</p><h3>Step 4: Check the length</h3><p>Check the length of your bangs. Remember that curly hair will shrink when it dries, so you may need to cut a little bit more off.</p><h3>Step 5: Style your bangs</h3><p>Style your bangs by using a diffuser to dry them. Use a curling iron or a flat iron to smooth out any frizz.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you’re still not sure how to cut bangs for curly hair, follow this step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep your hair</h3><p>Wash your hair and let it dry naturally.
