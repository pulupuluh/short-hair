Look no further because we have compiled a list of the best bangs for round face 2020. This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about choosing the right bangs for your face shape.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Choosing the right bangs for a round face can be a daunting task. The key is to choose bangs that will elongate your face and create an illusion of length. The right bangs can help balance out the roundness and create a more flattering look.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Bangs for Round Face?</h2><p>There are several factors to consider when choosing the best bangs for round face 2020. One of the most important factors is the length and shape of your face. Here are some tips to help you choose the right bangs:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step in choosing the right bangs for your round face is to determine your face shape. Use a measuring tape to measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. If all three measurements are similar, then you have a round face shape.</p><h3>Step 2: Consider Your Hair Type</h3><p>Consider your hair type when choosing the right bangs for your round face. If you have thick hair, opt for blunt bangs that will help frame your face. If you have thin hair, choose wispy bangs that will add volume to your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>Choose the right length of bangs based on the length of your face. For round faces, it is best to choose longer bangs that will elongate your face. Avoid short bangs that will make your face appear rounder.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Bangs for Round Face</h2><p>Now that you have chosen the right bangs for your round face, here is a step-by-step guide on how to style them:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and condition your hair before styling your bangs. This will help remove any dirt or oil that might be on your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow dry your hair using a round brush. This will help add volume to your hair and create a more flattering look.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Flat Iron</h3><p>Use a flat iron to smooth out your bangs. This will help create a more polished look.</p><h3>Step 4: Apply Hair Serum</h3><p>Apply a hair serum to your bangs to add shine and prevent frizz.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Bangs</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you maintain your bangs:</p><h3>Tip 1: Trim Your Bangs Regularly</h3><p>Trim your bangs regularly to keep them looking neat and tidy. This will also prevent them from becoming too long and covering your eyes.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Touching Your Bangs Too Much</h3><p>Avoid touching your bangs too much as this can cause them to become greasy and lose their shape.</p><h3>Tip 3: Use Dry Shampoo</h3><p>Use dry shampoo to absorb any excess oil on your bangs. This will help keep them looking fresh and clean.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Can round faces have bangs?</h3><p>A: Yes, round faces can have bangs. The key is to choose the right length and shape of bangs that will flatter your face shape.</p><h3>Q: What type of bangs are best for round faces?</h3><p>A: Longer, side-swept bangs are best for round faces. They help create an illusion of length and balance out the roundness of the face.</p><h3>Q: How often should I trim my bangs?</h3><p>A: It is recommended to trim your bangs every 4-6 weeks to keep them looking neat and tidy.</p><h2>Hair Care for Bangs</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for maintaining healthy and beautiful bangs. Here are some tips to help you take care of your bangs:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use a Shampoo and Conditioner Specifically Designed for Your Hair Type</h3><p>Using a shampoo and conditioner that is specifically designed for your hair type will help keep your hair healthy and strong.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Using Heat Styling Tools Too Often</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools too often as this can damage your hair and cause split ends.</p><h3>Tip 3: Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a hair serum that contains SPF.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing the best bangs for round face 2020 can be a challenging task, but with the right tips and tricks, you can find the perfect bangs that will flatter your face shape. Remember to consider your face shape, hair type, and the right length of bangs when choosing the perfect style.
