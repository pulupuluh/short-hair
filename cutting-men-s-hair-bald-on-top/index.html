This trend has been adopted by many men who want to achieve an edgy and modern look. However, it is important to note that cutting hair bald on top requires skill and precision. In this guide, we will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to achieve this hairstyle, as well as tips and information on hair care.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The bald on top hairstyle is achieved by cutting the hair on the top of the head very short or completely shaved off, while leaving the sides and back longer. This creates a contrast between the bald top and longer sides and back. It is a popular hairstyle for men who want a low-maintenance look that is both stylish and modern.</p><h2>How to Cut Men's Hair Bald on Top</h2><h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure that the hair is clean and dry.

You will need a pair of clippers, a comb, and a pair of scissors.</p><h3>Step 2: Determine the Length</h3><p>Decide on the length you want for the top of the head. Use the clippers to cut the hair as short as possible. If you want a completely bald look, use a razor to shave off the hair completely. Be careful when using a razor and make sure to use a shaving cream to avoid irritation.</p><h3>Step 3: Blend the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use the clippers to blend the sides and back of the head with the top. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to make sure that the transition is smooth. Make sure to check for any unevenness and make adjustments as necessary.</p><h3>Step 4: Clean Up</h3><p>Use the scissors to trim any stray hairs and make sure that the cut is even. Use the clippers to trim the hair around the neck and ears. Clean up any loose hairs and wash the hair to remove any clippings.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Men's Hair Bald on Top</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting men's hair bald on top:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down to ensure that the cut is even.</li><li>Use a mirror to check for any unevenness and make adjustments as necessary.</li><li>Be careful when using a razor and make sure to use a shaving cream to avoid irritation.</li><li>Use a moisturizing lotion or oil to keep the scalp moisturized and prevent dryness.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Is it easy to cut men's hair bald on top?</h3><p>While cutting men's hair bald on top may seem simple, it requires skill and precision.
