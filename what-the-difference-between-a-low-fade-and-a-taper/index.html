Two popular choices are the low fade and the taper. While both styles involve cutting the hair shorter towards the bottom, there are some key differences between the two. In this article, we'll break down the differences between a low fade and a taper.</p><h2>What is a Low Fade?</h2><p>A low fade is a haircut that involves cutting the hair shorter towards the bottom of the head. The fade starts at the bottom of the hairline and gradually fades into longer hair towards the top of the head. This style is often worn with longer hair on top that can be styled in a variety of ways.</p><h3>How to Get a Low Fade</h3><p>To get a low fade, you'll need to visit a barber or hairstylist who is skilled in this style. They will use clippers to gradually cut the hair shorter towards the bottom of the head. The fade can be blended into the longer hair on top using scissors or clippers.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining a Low Fade</h3><p>To maintain a low fade, you'll need to visit the barber or hairstylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim. You can also use a styling product to keep the longer hair on top in place.</p><h3>FAQ about Low Fade</h3><p><strong>Q: Can I get a low fade with curly hair?</strong><br/>A: Yes, a low fade can work well with curly hair. Just make sure to find a hairstylist who is experienced with cutting curly hair.</p><p><strong>Q: Will a low fade look good on me?</strong><br/>A: That depends on your face shape and hair texture. It's best to consult with a hairstylist to determine if a low fade is the right choice for you.</p><h3>How to Care for a Low Fade</h3><p>To care for a low fade, you'll need to wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. You can also use a styling product to keep the longer hair on top in place.</p><h2>What is a Taper?</h2><p>A taper is a haircut that involves cutting the hair shorter towards the bottom of the head. Unlike a fade, which gradually fades into longer hair, a taper is a more gradual transition. The hair is cut shorter towards the bottom of the head, but there is no distinct line between the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back.</p><h3>How to Get a Taper</h3><p>To get a taper, you'll need to visit a barber or hairstylist who is skilled in this style.
