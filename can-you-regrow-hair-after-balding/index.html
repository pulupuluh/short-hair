While it's normal to lose some hair every day, excessive hair loss can result in bald patches or a receding hairline. This can be distressing for many people, but there are ways to promote hair growth and potentially regrow hair.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Regrow Hair After Balding</h2><p>Regrowing hair after balding is possible, but it depends on the cause of the hair loss. For example, if hair loss is due to genetics, it may be more difficult to regrow hair.

Foods that are good for hair health include salmon, eggs, spinach, nuts, and avocados.</p><h3>Scalp massage</h3><p>Massaging the scalp can stimulate hair follicles and promote hair growth. Use gentle pressure and circular motions to massage the scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><h3>Minoxidil</h3><p>Minoxidil is an over-the-counter medication that can promote hair growth. It's applied directly to the scalp and may take several months to see results.</p><h3>Propecia</h3><p>Propecia is a prescription medication that can help slow or stop hair loss. It works by blocking the production of a hormone that causes hair loss.
