While it's normal to lose some hair every day, excessive hair loss can result in bald patches or a receding hairline. This can be distressing for many people, but there are ways to promote hair growth and potentially regrow hair.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Regrow Hair After Balding</h2><p>Regrowing hair after balding is possible, but it depends on the cause of the hair loss.

Use gentle pressure and circular motions to massage the scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><h3>Minoxidil</h3><p>Minoxidil is an over-the-counter medication that can promote hair growth. It's applied directly to the scalp and may take several months to see results.</p><h3>Propecia</h3><p>Propecia is a prescription medication that can help slow or stop hair loss.
