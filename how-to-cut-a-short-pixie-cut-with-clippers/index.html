A short pixie cut might be just what you need! And the best part is, you can achieve this trendy and edgy look with clippers right at home. In this article, we will guide you through the process of how to cut a short pixie cut with clippers, step by step.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A pixie cut is a short hairstyle that is usually cut close to the scalp. It is a popular style among women who want to look bold and confident. A short pixie cut with clippers is an easy and quick way to achieve this look. Clippers are a type of hair cutting tool that uses a motor to move blades back and forth rapidly. They are commonly used by barbers and hairstylists to create short and precise cuts.</p><h2>How to Cut a Short Pixie Cut with Clippers</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather your tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have all the necessary tools. You will need a pair of clippers, different clipper guards, a comb, scissors, and a mirror. You should also have a towel or cape to cover your clothes and protect them from hair clippings.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>It is important to wash your hair before cutting it to remove any dirt, oil, or styling products. After washing, dry your hair completely with a towel or a hairdryer.</p><h3>Step 3: Section your hair</h3><p>Using a comb, section your hair into several parts. Start at the back of your head and work your way towards the front. Use hair clips to secure each section.</p><h3>Step 4: Choose the right guard</h3><p>Choose the clipper guard that corresponds to the length you want your hair to be. Start with a larger guard and work your way down to a smaller guard as you get closer to the sides and back of your head.</p><h3>Step 5: Start cutting</h3><p>Start at the back of your head and work your way towards the front. Use the clippers to cut your hair in an upward motion against the direction of hair growth. Be careful not to cut too much hair at once. Repeat this process for each section of your hair.</p><h3>Step 6: Blend the sides and back</h3><p>Use a smaller guard to blend the sides and back of your head. Start at the bottom and work your way upwards in a sweeping motion. Make sure to blend the hair seamlessly to avoid any harsh lines.</p><h3>Step 7: Cut the top</h3><p>Using scissors, cut the hair on the top of your head to the desired length. Start at the crown and work your way towards the front of your head. Use the comb to lift the hair up and cut it evenly.</p><h3>Step 8: Trim the bangs</h3><p>If you want to have bangs, use scissors to cut them to the desired length. Cut them while they are dry to avoid any mistakes.</p><h3>Step 9: Clean up</h3><p>After you finish cutting your hair, clean up any loose hair clippings with a brush or towel. Take a shower to wash away any remaining hair and refresh your scalp.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>- Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard to avoid cutting too much hair at once.</p><p>- Use a mirror to check the back of your head and make sure your hair is even.</p><p>- If you are not sure about cutting your hair, start with a small section and see how it looks before continuing.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I cut my hair with clippers if I have curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your curly hair with clippers. However, you should use a larger guard to avoid cutting your curls too short.</p><h3>Can I cut my hair with clippers if I have thin hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your thin hair with clippers. However, you should choose a guard that is appropriate for your hair thickness to avoid cutting too much hair at once.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After you cut your hair, it is important to take care of it to maintain its health and shine. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type. Avoid using hot styling tools too often and protect your hair from the sun and harsh weather. Trim your hair regularly to keep it looking neat and fresh.</p><p>Cutting a short pixie cut with clippers is a fun and easy way to change your look. With these simple steps and tips, you can achieve a trendy and stylish haircut right at home.</p></article>
