Some short hairstyles look great on oval or heart-shaped faces, while others may not look as flattering on round or square faces.

Short haircuts work best on hair that is naturally straight or has a slight wave to it. If you have curly or kinky hair, a short hairstyle may not suit you as it can be challenging to manage and style.</p><p>If you still want to try a short hairstyle, you can opt for a layered cut that works well with curly hair.
