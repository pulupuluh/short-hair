For example, if you have a round face, a layered bob can help elongate your face.</li><li><strong>Hair texture:</strong> Your hair texture can also play a role in choosing the right medium hairstyle.

If you have coarse hair, layers can help soften your curls.</li><li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Consider your lifestyle when choosing a medium hairstyle. If you're busy and on-the-go, a low-maintenance style may be best.
