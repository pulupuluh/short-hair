Some tips for hair care include:</p><ul><li>Exfoliate the skin regularly to prevent ingrown hairs.</li><li>Moisturize the skin to prevent dryness and irritation.</li><li>Avoid tight clothing that can rub against the skin and cause irritation.</li><li>Avoid sun exposure to prevent skin damage and discoloration.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Is it mandatory to remove hair from arms and legs in Islam?</h3><p>No, it is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended.</p><h3>Can women remove hair from their arms and legs?</h3><p>Yes, women can remove hair from their arms and legs.</p><h3>Is it haram (forbidden) for men to remove hair from their arms and legs?</h3><p>No, it is not haram for men to remove hair from their arms and legs.</p><h3>Can hair removal be done during Ramadan?</h3><p>Yes, hair removal can be done during Ramadan.
