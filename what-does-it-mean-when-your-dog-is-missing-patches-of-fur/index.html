However, it can be concerning when you notice that your furry friend is missing patches of fur. Hair loss in dogs, also known as alopecia, can be caused by a variety of factors such as allergies, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and more. It's important to identify the cause to determine the appropriate treatment for your dog.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Check for Missing Patches of Fur</h2><p>The best way to check for missing patches of fur in your dog is to give them a thorough inspection.

If you notice any irregularities, such as bald patches or thinning hair, it's best to consult with your veterinarian.</p><h3>Step 1: Inspect Your Dog's Coat</h3><p>Start by inspecting your dog's coat from head to toe. Look for any bald patches, scabs, or redness on their skin. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, take note and move on to the next step.</p><h3>Step 2: Feel for Lumps and Bumps</h3><p>Use your fingers to feel around your dog's body. Pay close attention to areas such as their neck, back, and tail. If you feel any lumps or bumps, take note and move on to the next step.</p><h3>Step 3: Check for Fleas and Ticks</h3><p>Fleas and ticks can cause hair loss in dogs. Check your dog's coat for any signs of these pests.
