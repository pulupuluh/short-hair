Comb your hair straight down and part it in the middle.</li><li>Find the spot where you want your fringe to start. This could be right above your eyebrows or slightly higher.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the front and comb it straight down.

If you want to maintain a short fringe, you may need to trim it every 2-4 weeks.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I cut my fringe while it's wet?</strong></p><p>A: It's best to cut your fringe while it's dry, as wet hair can appear longer than it actually is. However, you can dampen your hair with a spray bottle if it's too difficult to work with while dry.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I cut my fringe myself or go to a salon?</strong></p><p>A: It depends on your comfort level and experience with cutting hair.
