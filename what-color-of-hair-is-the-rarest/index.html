This is due to a genetic mutation in the MC1R gene, which is responsible for producing the pigment that gives hair its color. Red hair is most commonly found in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, with some regions of Russia and Scandinavia also having higher rates of redheads.</p><p>Interestingly, redheads also have a higher pain tolerance and are more resistant to certain diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. They also require less vitamin D than people with other hair colors because their fair skin allows them to absorb more sunlight.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Hair Color</h3><p>Determining your hair color can be a bit tricky, especially if you're trying to match a specific shade. The best way to do this is to start by identifying your natural hair color.
