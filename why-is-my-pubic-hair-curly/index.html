It is coarser, curlier, and thicker. The curly nature of pubic hair is due to the shape of the hair follicle. Hair follicles are responsible for hair growth, and they come in different shapes. The hair follicles on our heads are generally round, while the hair follicles in our pubic region are oval-shaped. This oval shape causes the hair to grow in a curly pattern.</p><p>Another reason for curly pubic hair is hormones. Hormones play a significant role in determining the texture of our hair. During puberty, the body produces more androgens, which are male hormones. Androgens can cause the hair to become curly or wavy.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h3><p>If you want to keep your pubic hair healthy, here are some steps you can follow:</p><ol><li>Trim regularly: Trimming your pubic hair regularly can prevent ingrown hairs and keep your hair neat.</li><li>Wash daily: Washing your pubic hair daily can prevent infections and keep the area clean.</li><li>Moisturize: Use a moisturizing lotion or oil to keep your pubic hair soft and healthy.</li><li>Avoid harsh products: Avoid using harsh soaps or chemicals on your pubic hair, as they can cause irritation and dryness.</li><li>Wear breathable clothing: Wearing breathable clothing can prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to infections.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>Here are some additional tips for maintaining healthy pubic hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid tight clothing: Tight clothing can rub against your pubic hair, causing irritation and ingrown hairs.</li><li>Use a soft brush: Use a soft-bristled brush to detangle your pubic hair, as it is delicate and can break easily.</li><li>Don't shave too often: Shaving too often can cause razor burn and ingrown hairs.
