Here's what you'll need to get started: <ul><li>Rat-tail comb</li><li>Hair clips</li><li>Hair gel or wax</li><li>Small rubber bands</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2> Follow these steps to give yourself cornrows: <ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair. If your hair is long, consider trimming it before starting.</li><li>Use the rat-tail comb to part your hair into sections. Start at the front of your head and create a straight part down the middle. Then, create another part on each side of the center part. Clip the hair in each section out of the way.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the front of the center part. Divide it into three equal sections.</li><li>Begin braiding the hair by crossing the right section over the middle section, then the left section over the middle section. As you braid, add a small section of hair from each side to the braid. This will create the cornrow pattern.</li><li>Continue braiding the hair in this pattern, adding small sections of hair as you go, until you reach the nape of your neck. Secure the end of the braid with a small rubber band.</li><li>Repeat this process on the other side of the center part, creating a matching cornrow.</li><li>Continue creating cornrows along the sides of your head, working your way towards the back. Be sure to keep the sections of hair even and the braids tight.</li><li>When you reach the back of your head, you can either continue creating cornrows or switch to a different braiding pattern.</li><li>Once all of the cornrows are complete, use hair gel or wax to smooth down any flyaways and give the style a polished look.</li><li>Take out the hair clips and admire your new cornrow style!</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Giving Yourself Cornrows</h2> Here are some tips to keep in mind when giving yourself cornrows: <ul><li>Practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if your first attempt doesn't turn out perfectly. Keep practicing and you'll get better over time.</li><li>Make sure your hair is completely dry before starting. Wet hair can be more difficult to braid and may not hold the style as well.</li><li>Use hair gel or wax to help control flyaways and keep the style in place.</li><li>Don't braid too tightly. While it's important to keep the braids secure, braiding too tightly can cause pain and damage to your hair and scalp.</li><li>Take breaks as needed. Braiding your hair can be time-consuming and tiring, so don't be afraid to take breaks and come back to it later.</li></ul><h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take to give yourself cornrows?</h3> The amount of time it takes to give yourself cornrows will depend on your skill level and the complexity of the style. Generally, it can take anywhere from 2-4 hours to complete a full head of cornrows. <h3>Can I cornrow my hair if it's short?</h3> Yes, you can still cornrow your hair if it's short. Just make sure to start with clean, dry hair and use smaller sections to create the braids. <h3>How long do cornrows last?</h3> Cornrows can last anywhere from 2-6 weeks, depending on how well you take care of them and how quickly your hair grows. <h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Cornrows</h2> To keep your cornrows looking great, here are some hair care tips to follow: <ul><li>Wash your hair regularly, but be gentle when shampooing and avoid rubbing the braids too hard.</li><li>Use a lightweight oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil, to moisturize your scalp and hair.</li><li>Avoid using heavy products that can weigh down your hair and cause buildup.</li><li>Protect your hair at night by wearing a silk or satin bonnet or using a silk or satin pillowcase.</li><li>Don't leave your cornrows in for too long. After a few weeks, it's important to take them out and give your hair a break to prevent damage and breakage.</li></ul> Now that you know how to give yourself cornrows as a guy, it's time to give it a try! With some practice and patience, you'll be rocking a fresh new style in no time. </article>
