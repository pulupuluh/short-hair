If you're here, you're probably wondering if it's possible to relax short hair. The answer is yes, it is possible, and we're here to guide you through the process. In this article, we'll cover everything you need to know about relaxing short hair, from how to do it to how to take care of your newly relaxed locks.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Relaxing short hair involves chemically straightening the hair to make it more manageable and easier to style. The process involves applying a relaxer cream to the hair, which breaks down the protein bonds in the hair shaft, allowing it to be reshaped. The result is straight, smooth hair that is easier to style and maintain.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Before relaxing short hair, it's important to prepare your hair and scalp. Start by washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or residue. Next, section your hair into four parts and apply petroleum jelly to your scalp and hairline to protect your skin from the relaxer cream. Then, apply the relaxer cream to your hair, starting at the back and working your way towards the front.</p><p>Leave the relaxer cream on your hair for the recommended amount of time, usually between 10-20 minutes. Be sure to monitor your hair during this time to avoid overprocessing, which can cause damage to your hair and scalp. After the recommended time, rinse the relaxer cream out of your hair with warm water and apply a neutralizing shampoo to stop the chemical process.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Prepare your hair and scalp</h3><p>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or residue.
