Here are a few ways to do so:</p><h3>Braiding Method</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to achieve wavy curly hair without heat is to braid your hair. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Once your hair is damp, braid it into multiple sections. The more sections you braid, the tighter the curls will be. Leave your hair braided overnight or until it is completely dry. Once you take out the braids, use your fingers to separate the curls and create a wavy look.</p><h3>Twist Method</h3><p>The twist method is another easy way to achieve wavy curly hair without heat. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Once your hair is damp, twist sections of your hair around your fingers, creating a spiral. Leave your hair twisted overnight or until it is completely dry. Once you take out the twists, use your fingers to separate the curls and create a wavy look.</p><h3>Roller Method</h3><p>If you have larger rollers, you can use them to create wavy curly hair without heat. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Once your hair is damp, divide it into sections and wrap each section around a roller. Leave the rollers in overnight or until your hair is completely dry. Once you take out the rollers, use your fingers to separate the curls and create a wavy look.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you're still unsure of how to achieve wavy curly hair without heat, follow these simple steps:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair.</li><li>Choose a method (braiding, twisting, or rolling) to create your curls.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections.</li><li>Use the chosen method to create curls in each section.</li><li>Leave your hair to dry overnight or until it is completely dry.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use your fingers to separate the curls and create a wavy look.</li><li>Apply a hair serum or oil to add shine and reduce frizz.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Here are a few tips and tricks to help you achieve the perfect wavy curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair before creating curls.</li><li>Apply a styling mousse or gel to add hold to your curls.</li><li>If you have naturally straight hair, try using smaller sections to create tighter curls.</li><li>Apply a heat protectant spray before using any heat tools on your hair.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can I use heat protectant spray with the braiding, twisting, or rolling method?</h3><p>No, heat protectant spray is only used when using heat tools such as curling irons or flat irons.
