If you're considering a hair change, whether it's a big chop, color, or cut, bangs are a great way to switch up your look. However, before diving in, it's important to consider how bangs will work with your hair texture. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about getting bangs with wavy hair, including how to style them and how to care for your new 'do.</p><h2>How To Determine If Bangs Will Work With Your Wavy Hair</h2><p>Before jumping into the world of bangs, it's important to determine if they'll work with your hair texture. Wavy hair can be tricky to work with, as it tends to have a mind of its own. However, the good news is that there are plenty of bang styles that work well with wavy hair. Here are some things to consider when deciding if bangs are right for you:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>The first thing to consider when deciding if bangs will work with your wavy hair is your face shape. While bangs can work with any face shape, certain styles may be more flattering on specific face shapes. For example, if you have a round face, side-swept bangs can help to elongate your face, while blunt bangs may make your face appear shorter and wider.</p><h3>Hair Texture</h3><p>Another thing to consider when deciding if bangs will work with your wavy hair is your hair texture. While wavy hair can work well with bangs, it's important to choose a style that complements your natural texture. For example, if you have thick, coarse waves, heavy blunt bangs may be too much for your hair to handle. Instead, consider softer, side-swept bangs that will blend with your waves.</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>The final thing to consider when deciding if bangs will work with your wavy hair is your lifestyle. Bangs require regular maintenance, so if you're not up for frequent salon visits or daily styling, bangs may not be the best option for you. However, if you're willing to put in the effort, bangs can be a great way to switch up your look.</p><h2>How To Style Bangs With Wavy Hair</h2><p>Once you've decided to take the plunge and get bangs with your wavy hair, the next step is to learn how to style them.
