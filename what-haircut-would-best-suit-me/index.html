There are four main face shapes: round, oval, square, and heart-shaped.

Oval faces can pull off almost any hairstyle, but a shoulder-length cut with layers can highlight your cheekbones. Square faces can soften their features with a layered bob or a long layered cut with a side-swept fringe. Heart-shaped faces can look great with pixie cuts or short bobs that accentuate the jawline.</p><p>Another factor to consider is your hair texture.
