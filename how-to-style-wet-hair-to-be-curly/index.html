Take a small section of hair and apply a styling gel or mousse. Make sure to evenly distribute the product throughout the section of hair.</p><p>Using a curling wand or curling iron, wrap the section of hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for a few seconds, then release. Repeat this process for all sections of hair.</p><p>Once all sections of hair are curled, scrunch your hair with your hands. This will help to loosen the curls and give them a more natural look. Allow your hair to air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. </p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Wet Your Hair</h3><p>Make sure your hair is completely wet.
