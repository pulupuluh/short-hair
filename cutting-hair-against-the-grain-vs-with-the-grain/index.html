This technique is often used to achieve a closer and smoother cut, as it allows the hair to be cut at a shorter length.

This technique is often used to maintain length and shape, as well as to prevent the hair from becoming too short or damaged.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>Before deciding whether to cut hair against or with the grain, it's important to understand the texture and growth pattern of the hair.
