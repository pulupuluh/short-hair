Avoid using hot tools like straighteners or curling irons, and opt for natural hairstyles instead.</p><h2 id="faq"> FAQs </h2><h3> Q: What type of hat is best for windy weather? </h3><p> A: A hat with a snug fit, like a beanie or a baseball cap, is best for windy weather. It will stay in place and protect your hair from the wind. </p><h3> Q: How often should I apply hair product to my hair? </h3><p> A: It depends on the product you're using.
