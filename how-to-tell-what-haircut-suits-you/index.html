Here are some tips on how to tell what haircut suits you:</p><h3>1. Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step in choosing the right haircut is to determine your face shape.

Each hair type requires a different type of haircut to look its best.</p><h3>3. Think About Your Lifestyle</h3><p>Your lifestyle is also an important factor to consider when choosing a haircut. If you have a busy schedule, you may want a low-maintenance haircut that requires minimal styling. If you attend formal events regularly, you may want a more formal haircut that can be styled for different occasions.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to tell what haircut suits you:</p><h3>1.
