Look for shampoos and conditioners that are gentle and moisturizing, and avoid products that contain harsh chemicals like sulfates and parabens.</p><h3>Consider Your Hair Type</h3><p>When choosing a shampoo and conditioner, it's important to consider your hair type. If you have fine, thinning hair, look for products that add volume and thickness. If you have thick, curly hair, look for products that define and hydrate your curls.</p><h3>Read Reviews</h3><p>Reading reviews from other women over 60 can be a great way to find the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair.
