Look for shampoos and conditioners that are specifically formulated for black hair, as they will be gentle and nourishing. Avoid products that contain sulfates, as these can strip your hair of its natural oils and cause it to become dry and brittle.</p><p>When washing your hair, start by wetting it thoroughly with warm water. Apply a small amount of shampoo to your scalp and massage it in gently with your fingertips. Be sure to focus on your scalp, as this is where the majority of the dirt and oil accumulates. Rinse the shampoo out thoroughly with warm water.</p><p>Next, apply a generous amount of conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends. Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the conditioner evenly and detangle your hair. Leave the conditioner in for a few minutes, then rinse it out with cool water.
