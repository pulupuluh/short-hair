Some people may experience gradual hair thinning over time, while others may notice sudden hair loss in patches or overall thinning.</p><p>If you're experiencing sudden hair loss, it's important to identify the underlying cause to determine the best course of action.

Try to avoid using hot tools like curling irons and straighteners, or use them on a low heat setting.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair</h3><p>When outdoors, protect your hair from the sun and wind by wearing a hat or scarf. Also, avoid tight hairstyles that can put tension on your hair and lead to breakage.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're experiencing sudden hair loss, here are some steps you can take:</p><h3>Step 1: Identify the Underlying Cause</h3><p>The first step in treating hair loss is to identify the underlying cause.
