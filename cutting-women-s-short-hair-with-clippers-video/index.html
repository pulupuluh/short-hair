Once you have chosen the right size, you can begin the cutting process.</p><p>Start by sectioning the hair into small sections. The smaller the section, the more precise the cut will be. Use a comb to comb the hair in the direction you want to cut it. Then, using the clippers, start at the nape of the neck and work your way up to the crown of the head. Use a sweeping motion to cut the hair, and make sure to keep the clippers at a consistent angle.</p><p>Once you have finished the back of the head, move on to the sides.

Make sure to keep the clippers at a consistent angle and use a sweeping motion to cut the hair.</p><p>The last step is to cut the top of the head. Use the same sweeping motion and consistent angle to cut the hair. You can use a comb to lift the hair and cut it to the desired length. Once you have finished cutting the hair, use scissors to trim any stray hairs and create a clean, even look.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>1. Choose the right clipper size.</p><p>2.
