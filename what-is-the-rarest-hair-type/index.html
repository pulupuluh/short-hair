There are four main hair types: straight, wavy, curly, and coily. However, there is one hair type that is considered the rarest of them all. This hair type is known as the 'Zigzag Hair Type'.</p><p>Only a small percentage of the population is born with this hair type.

Hair can be fine, medium, or coarse. Fine hair is delicate and thin, while coarse hair is thicker and stronger.</p><h3>Pattern of Hair</h3><p>The pattern of your hair refers to the way your hair curls or waves. Hair can be classified into four main patterns: Type 1 (straight), Type 2 (wavy), Type 3 (curly), and Type 4 (coily).</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide to Identify Your Hair Type</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to help you determine your hair type:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a mild shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Let your hair air-dry without using any styling products.</li><li>Look at the shape of your hair follicle.
