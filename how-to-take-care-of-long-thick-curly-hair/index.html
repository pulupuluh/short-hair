It will help to detangle your hair without causing breakage or damage. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots.</p><h3>4. Deep Condition Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Deep conditioning your hair regularly can help to keep it healthy and hydrated. Look for a deep conditioning treatment that is specifically designed for curly hair, and use it once a week to keep your curls looking their best.</p><h3>5.
