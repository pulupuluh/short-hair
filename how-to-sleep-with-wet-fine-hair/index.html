Use a Microfiber Towel</h3><p>Gently towel-dry your hair before going to bed, using a microfiber towel. Microfiber towels are more absorbent than regular cotton towels and are gentle on your hair. They will absorb excess water without damaging your hair.</p><h3>2. Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner or a hair oil to your wet hair before going to bed. This will help to keep your hair moisturized and protected while you sleep. Choose a lightweight leave-in conditioner that won't weigh down your hair.</p><h3>3.
