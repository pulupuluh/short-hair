The best round hairbrush for fine and thin hair is the one that is gentle on your hair, easy to use, and creates the desired style. </p><h2>How-to</h2><p>Before you start using a round brush, make sure your hair is clean and dry. You can use a detangling brush or comb to remove any tangles or knots. Next, apply a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from the heat of the brush. Then, section your hair into manageable parts, starting from the bottom. Use the round brush to lift your hair from the roots and wrap it around the brush. Blow-dry your hair using the brush, moving it away from the roots towards the ends. Repeat the process until your hair is dry and styled as desired.</p><h2>Step-by-Step</h2><p>1.
