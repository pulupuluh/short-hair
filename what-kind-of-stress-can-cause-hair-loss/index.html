One of the most common signs is an increase in shedding. You may notice more hair falling out than usual when you brush or wash your hair. Another sign is a change in the texture or thickness of your hair. Stress-related hair loss can cause your hair to become brittle and thin.</p><p>If you are unsure whether your hair loss is related to stress, it is important to see a doctor or dermatologist.
