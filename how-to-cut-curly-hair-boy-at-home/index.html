Don’t use a blow dryer as it can cause frizz and damage the hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Comb and Section</h3><p>Once the hair is dry, comb it through to remove any tangles. Then, use clips to section off the hair into manageable sections.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Take one section of hair at a time and dampen it with the spray bottle. Comb it through again to make sure it’s smooth. Then, starting at the ends, trim off any split ends or damaged hair. Work your way up the hair, cutting small sections at a time. Remember to cut less than you think you need to.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Once you’ve cut all the sections, blend the hair together by combing it through again. Check to make sure there aren’t any uneven spots or long strands.</p><h3>Step 5: Check the Length</h3><p>Check the length of the hair to make sure it’s the desired length. If it’s too long, you can go back and trim some more. If it’s too short, you’ll have to wait for it to grow out.</p><h3>Step 6: Clean Up</h3><p>Once you’re done cutting, clean up any stray hairs and put away your tools.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to make cutting curly hair boy at home easier:</p><ul><li>Work in small sections to ensure even cutting</li><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid split ends</li><li>Cut less than you think you need to</li><li>Don’t use a blow dryer to dry the hair</li><li>Check the length as you go</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>How often should I cut my boy’s curly hair?</h3><p>It depends on how fast his hair grows and how short you want it.
