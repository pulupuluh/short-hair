This method works best for guys with medium to long hair. Here's how to do it:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair and let it air dry until it's about 80% dry.</li><li>Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair to prevent damage.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections and use a curling iron or wand to curl each section.</li><li>Once you've curled all of your hair, use your fingers to separate the curls and add volume.</li><li>Finish with a light hold hairspray to keep the curls in place.</li></ol><h3 id="perm">Perm</h3><p>Another option for getting curly hair is to get a perm. A perm is a chemical treatment that changes the structure of your hair, making it curly. This method is best for guys with short hair. Here's what to expect:</p><ol><li>Choose a stylist who specializes in perms and book an appointment.</li><li>During the appointment, your stylist will apply a chemical solution to your hair and wrap it in rods.</li><li>After a certain amount of time, the rods will be removed and your hair will be rinsed.</li><li>You'll need to avoid washing your hair for a few days after the perm to allow the curls to set.</li></ol><h3 id="natural-methods">Natural Methods</h3><p>If you're not a fan of heat styling or chemical treatments, there are natural methods you can use to encourage your hair to curl.
