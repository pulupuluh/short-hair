Getting Rid of Stringy ends + Tips for Low Density Curls</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>Curly hair can be both a blessing and a curse. On good days, your curls are bouncy, defined, and Instagram-worthy. On bad days, however, your hair can turn into a frizzy mess, especially when humidity is high. If you're tired of dealing with unruly, frizzy hair every time the weather changes, you've come to the right place. In this blog post, we'll share some tips and tricks on how to control curly hair in humidity, so you can enjoy your curls all year round.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>First things first: it's important to understand why curly hair tends to get frizzy in humidity. When the air is humid, there's more moisture in the air, and curly hair is more porous than straight hair, which means it can absorb more moisture from the air. The result? Frizz. The good news is that there are several things you can do to prevent frizz and keep your curls looking their best, even on the most humid days.</p><h3>Step by Step</h3><p>1. Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner: Start by using a hydrating shampoo and conditioner that will help keep your hair moisturized. Look for products that contain ingredients like glycerin, aloe vera, and coconut oil, which are known for their hydrating properties.</p><p>2. Apply a leave-in conditioner: After washing your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner to your curls. This will help lock in moisture and prevent frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the product evenly through your hair.</p><p>3. Use a curl-defining product: To help define your curls and keep them from frizzing, use a curl-defining product like a curl cream, gel, or mousse. Apply the product to damp hair, scrunching your curls as you go.</p><p>4. Avoid touching your hair: Once you've applied your products, avoid touching your hair as much as possible. The oils and dirt from your hands can transfer to your hair, making it look greasy and weighing down your curls.</p><p>5. Use a diffuser: When blow-drying your hair, use a diffuser attachment to help distribute the heat evenly and prevent frizz. Hold the diffuser close to your scalp and move it around in a circular motion, scrunching your curls as you go.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>- Don't wash your hair too often: Over-washing curly hair can strip it of its natural oils, making it more prone to frizz. Aim to wash your hair no more than twice a week.</p><p>- Sleep on a silk pillowcase: Cotton pillowcases can cause friction, which can lead to frizz and breakage. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase will help keep your curls smooth and tangle-free.</p><p>- Use a hair mask: Once a week, treat your curls to a hydrating hair mask. This will help keep your hair moisturized and prevent frizz.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can I use hairspray to control frizz?</p><p>A: While hairspray can help hold your curls in place, it can also make your hair feel stiff and crunchy. Instead, opt for a curl-defining product like a curl cream or gel.</p><p>Q: How can I refresh my curls throughout the day?</p><p>A: If your curls start to look frizzy throughout the day, spritz them with a mixture of water and leave-in conditioner. Scrunch your hair to help revive your curls.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Remember, the key to controlling curly hair in humidity is to keep it moisturized. Be sure to use hydrating products and avoid over-washing your hair. With the right products and techniques, you can keep your curls looking bouncy and defined, no matter what the weather is like outside.</p></article>
