This type of hair is caused by the shape of the hair follicle, which is oval instead of round. Curly hair can range from loose waves to tight coils, and can vary in texture from fine to coarse.</p><p>There are three main types of curly hair:</p><h3>Type 2: Wavy Hair</h3><p>Wavy hair has loose, S-shaped waves that are closer to straight hair than curly hair.

This type of hair can be fine or coarse, and can be prone to frizz and dryness.</p><h3>Type 4: Coily Hair</h3><p>Coily hair has tight, springy coils that range in size from a pen spring to a crochet needle.

Here is a simple guide to help you determine your hair type:</p><p><strong>Type 2:</strong> Take a strand of hair and examine it. If it falls flat against your head and has a slight bend at the end, you have type 2 hair.</p><p><strong>Type 3:</strong> Take a strand of hair and examine it.

Here is a step-by-step guide to caring for curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo that won't strip your hair of its natural oils. Focus on your scalp and roots, and avoid rubbing your hair too vigorously.</p><h3>Step 2: Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Apply a moisturizing conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends. Detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb or your fingers, and let the conditioner sit for a few minutes before rinsing it out.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair to help lock in moisture and prevent frizz. Use a quarter-sized amount for medium-length hair, and distribute it evenly through your hair with your fingers.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Style your hair using a gel or curl cream that is formulated for your hair type. Apply it evenly to your hair, then scrunch your hair to encourage your curls to form.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining and Styling Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining and styling curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a satin or silk pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage</li><li>Don't brush your hair when it's dry, as it can cause breakage and frizz</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, as they can damage your hair</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends</li><li>Experiment with different hairstyles and products to find what works best for your hair</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Curly Hair</h2><p><strong>Q: Is curly hair more prone to breakage than straight hair?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, curly hair is more prone to breakage because of its delicate nature. It is important to handle your hair gently and use products that are specifically formulated for curly hair.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I wash my curly hair?</strong></p><p>A: It depends on your hair type and personal preference. Some people with curly hair can go several days without washing, while others prefer to wash their hair every other day.
