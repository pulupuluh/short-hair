Synthetic hair is made from plastic fibers and is typically less expensive than human hair. However, it can be difficult to style and may not look as natural as human hair. Human hair can be purchased in a variety of grades, with higher grades being more expensive. The highest grade of human hair is virgin hair, which has never been chemically treated or processed. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Best Hair Type to Buy</h2><p>When choosing a hair type to buy, consider your budget, lifestyle, and desired look.
