If you're using a curling iron or wand, set it to a lower temperature and use it sparingly.</p><h3>Set Your Waves with Hairspray</h3><p>Hairspray is a great way to set your waves and help them last all day. Look for a lightweight hairspray that won't weigh your hair down, and apply it to your waves after styling.</p><h3>Consider a Perm</h3><p>If you're looking for a more permanent solution to your wavy hair woes, consider getting a perm.
