It's also known as a boxy face, and people with square faces have a wide face shape with equal width and length. Celebrities like Angelina Jolie, Keira Knightley, and Olivia Wilde have square-shaped faces.</p><h2 id="best-short-haircuts">Best Short Haircuts for Square Face</h2><p>Short haircuts work well for square faces as they help soften the angles and draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones. Here are some of the best short haircuts for square face:</p><h3>1. Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a short haircut that's cropped close to the head. It's a popular choice for square faces as it helps elongate the face and draws attention to the eyes and cheekbones.</p><h3>2. Bob Cut</h3><p>A bob cut is a classic short haircut that's perfect for square faces. A chin-length bob with layers can soften the jawline and add volume to the crown, making the face appear longer.</p><h3>3. Shaggy Cut</h3><p>A shaggy cut is a layered haircut that's perfect for square faces. It adds texture and movement to the hair, softens the angles of the face, and draws attention to the eyes and cheekbones.</p><h3>4. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great choice for square faces. They add softness to the face, draw attention to the eyes, and balance out the strong jawline.</p><h3>5. Asymmetrical Cut</h3><p>An asymmetrical cut is a short haircut with uneven lengths on each side. It's a great choice for square faces as it adds an element of interest to the hair, draws attention away from the jawline, and elongates the face.</p><h2 id="how-to-choose">How to Choose the Right Haircut for Square Face?</h2><p>When choosing a haircut for square face, consider the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Face shape:</strong> Determine your face shape by measuring the length and width of your face. If you have a square-shaped face, choose a haircut that softens the angles of your face.</li><li><strong>Hair texture:</strong> Choose a haircut that works well with your hair texture. For example, if you have thick hair, a layered haircut can help reduce the volume.</li><li><strong>Personal style:</strong> Choose a haircut that reflects your personal style and makes you feel confident and comfortable.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Get a Short Haircut for Square Face</h2><p>Follow these steps to get a short haircut for square face:</p><ol><li>Choose a short haircut that flatters your face shape and hair texture.</li><li>Show a picture of the haircut to your hairstylist and discuss any modifications you want.</li><li>Wash your hair before the haircut.</li><li>Sit in the chair and let your hairstylist work their magic.</li><li>After the haircut, style your hair as desired.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips to Maintain Short Haircuts for Square Face</h2><p>Here are some tips to maintain short haircuts for square face:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape of your haircut.</li><li>Use styling products to add volume and texture to your hair.</li><li>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before styling.</li><li>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep it healthy and shiny.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Short Haircuts for Square Face</h2><h3>Q. Can square faces have long haircuts?</h3><p>A. Yes, square faces can have long haircuts. However, it's best to avoid straight, blunt cuts that accentuate the jawline.

Side-swept bangs are a great choice for square faces as they add softness to the face and balance out the strong jawline.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Square Face</h2><p>Here are some hair care tips for square face:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy.</li><li>Use a hairbrush with soft bristles to prevent damage to your hair.</li><li>Avoid using hot styling tools too often as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a hair mask once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair.</li></ul><p>With these tips and short haircuts for square face, you can enhance your best features and look fabulous.
