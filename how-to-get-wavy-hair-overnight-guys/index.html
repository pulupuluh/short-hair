Make sure to rinse thoroughly and remove all excess water.</p><h3>2. Apply Mousse</h3><p>Next, apply a golf ball-sized amount of mousse to your hair. This will help hold the waves in place and prevent frizz. Distribute the mousse evenly throughout your hair, making sure to cover the roots and tips.</p><h3>3. Braid Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into two sections and braid each section tightly. If you have thicker hair, you may need to create more braids. Make sure to secure the ends with a hair tie.</p><h3>4. Sleep on It</h3><p>Go to bed with your hair in braids and sleep on it overnight.
