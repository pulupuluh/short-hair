Hair Colouring Advice</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>If you're thinking about changing your hair colour, you might be wondering which colours will suit you best. With so many options out there, it can be overwhelming to figure out what will work for you. In this blog post, we'll help you determine the best hair colours for your skin tone, eye colour, and personal style. Read on for tips, tricks, and ideas to help you find your perfect hair colour in 2023.</p><h2>Description: Understanding Your Skin Tone</h2><p>The first step in figuring out what hair colours will suit you is to understand your skin tone. Your skin tone is determined by the amount of melanin in your skin, which affects how your skin responds to different colours. There are three main types of skin tones: cool, warm, and neutral.</p><p>Cool skin tones have pink or blue undertones, and look best with hair colours that have cool undertones, like ash blonde, platinum blonde, and cool brown. Warm skin tones have yellow or golden undertones, and look best with hair colours that have warm undertones, like golden blonde, caramel brown, and copper red. Neutral skin tones have a balance of both warm and cool undertones, and can pull off a wide range of hair colours.</p><h2>How To: Determine Your Skin Tone</h2><p>If you're not sure what your skin tone is, there are a few ways to figure it out. One method is to look at the veins on the underside of your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you have cool undertones. If they appear green, you have warm undertones. If they appear both blue and green, you have neutral undertones.</p><p>Another method is to hold up different coloured fabrics to your face and see which ones make your skin glow and which ones make it look dull. If you look best in cool colours like blue, purple, and green, you likely have cool undertones. If you look best in warm colours like red, orange, and yellow, you likely have warm undertones. If you look good in both cool and warm colours, you likely have neutral undertones.</p><h2>Step By Step: Choosing Your Hair Colour</h2><p>Once you've determined your skin tone, you can start thinking about which hair colours will suit you best. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Consider Your Natural Hair Colour</h3><p>If you're not looking for a drastic change, consider staying within a few shades of your natural hair colour. This will help your new hair colour look more natural and complement your skin tone.</p><h3>2. Look at Your Eye Colour</h3><p>Your eye colour can also play a role in which hair colours will suit you best. For example, if you have blue or green eyes, cool blonde or brunette shades will complement your eye colour. If you have brown or hazel eyes, warm shades like golden blonde or chestnut brown will bring out the warmth in your eyes.</p><h3>3. Consider Your Lifestyle</h3><p>If you lead an active lifestyle or don't have a lot of time for maintenance, consider a low-maintenance hair colour like balayage or ombre. These techniques create a natural-looking gradient effect that grows out gracefully and doesn't require frequent touch-ups.</p><h3>4. Get Inspiration</h3><p>Look online or in magazines for inspiration and ideas. Pinterest and Instagram are great resources for finding hair colour trends and styles. Bring photos of hairstyles you like to your hair stylist to help them understand your vision.</p><h2>Tips: Maintaining Your Hair Colour</h2><p>Once you've chosen your new hair colour, it's important to take care of it to make it last as long as possible. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Use Color-Safe Products</h3><p>Use shampoo, conditioner, and styling products that are specifically designed for colour-treated hair. These products will help protect your hair colour and prevent it from fading.</p><h3>2. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair and cause your colour to fade faster. Try to air dry your hair as much as possible, and use heat tools sparingly.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair From the Sun</h3><p>UV rays from the sun can cause your hair colour to fade. Wear a hat or use a hair product with SPF to protect your hair when you're outside.</p><h2>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Can I dye my hair a different colour if I have previously dyed it?</h3><p>A: Yes, but it's important to wait at least four weeks between dye jobs to give your hair time to recover. Also, keep in mind that dyeing your hair too frequently can damage it and make it more difficult to achieve your desired colour.</p><h3>Q: How often should I touch up my roots?</h3><p>A: It depends on how fast your hair grows and how noticeable your roots are. As a general rule, plan on touching up your roots every four to six weeks.</p><h3>Q: Can I dye my hair at home, or should I go to a salon?</h3><p>A: It's generally safer to go to a salon, especially if you're making a big change to your hair colour. A professional hair stylist can help you choose the right colour and ensure that it's applied correctly. However, if you're experienced with dyeing your hair at home and feel confident in your abilities, you can give it a try.</p><h2>Hair Care: Keeping Your Hair Healthy</h2><p>Finally, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and strong. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair With Care</h3><p>Use a gentle shampoo and don't scrub too hard. Rinse thoroughly to avoid leaving any product residue in your hair.</p><h3>2. Use Conditioner</h3><p>Conditioner helps keep your hair smooth and hydrated. Use a conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type, and apply it from mid-shaft to ends.</p><h3>3. Don't Over-Brush</h3><p>Brushing your hair too much can cause breakage and damage. Use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to gently work out any tangles.</p><p>With these tips and tricks, you're well on your way to finding the perfect hair colour for you in 2023. Remember to take care of your hair to keep it looking healthy and beautiful, and have fun experimenting with new colours and styles!</p></article>
