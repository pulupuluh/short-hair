It's a common concern, especially for people with round or oval-shaped faces. In this article, we'll explore this question and provide some tips on how to choose the right short haircut for your face shape. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ol><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ol><h2 id="description"> Description </h2><p> The answer to this question is not straightforward. Whether short hair makes your head look bigger or smaller depends on several factors, such as your face shape, hair texture, and the type of short haircut you choose. </p><p> If you have a round or oval-shaped face, you may want to avoid short haircuts that add volume to the top of your head. This can make your head look rounder and larger. Instead, opt for a short haircut that creates more angles and definition in your face. </p><p> On the other hand, if you have a long or narrow face, a short haircut that adds volume to the top of your head can balance out your features and make your head look smaller. </p><h2 id="how-to"> How to </h2><p> To determine whether short hair will make your head look bigger or smaller, you should consider your face shape and hair texture. Here are some tips on how to choose the right short haircut for your face shape: </p><h3> Round face </h3><p> If you have a round face, you should avoid short haircuts that add volume to the top of your head, such as a pixie cut or a bob with blunt bangs. Instead, opt for a short haircut that creates angles and definition in your face, such as a layered bob or a side-swept pixie. </p><h3> Oval face </h3><p> If you have an oval face, you can experiment with a variety of short haircuts. However, you should avoid short haircuts that are too voluminous or add width to your face. Instead, opt for a short haircut that emphasizes your cheekbones or jawline, such as a layered pixie or a textured bob. </p><h3> Long face </h3><p> If you have a long face, you can benefit from a short haircut that adds volume to the top of your head. This can balance out your features and make your head look smaller. Opt for a short haircut with layers or a textured fringe, such as a shaggy pixie or a messy bob. </p><h2 id="step-by-step"> Step by Step </h2><p> Here are some steps you can follow to choose the right short haircut for your face shape: </p><ol><li> Determine your face shape – You can do this by measuring the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. </li><li> Research short haircuts – Look for short haircuts that flatter your face shape and hair texture. </li><li> Consult with a hairstylist – A professional hairstylist can help you choose the right short haircut and provide styling tips. </li><li> Experiment with different styles – Don't be afraid to try different short haircuts until you find the one that suits you best. </li></ol><h2 id="tips"> Tips </h2><p> Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when choosing a short haircut: </p><ul><li> Consider your hair texture – Short haircuts may not work for all hair types, such as curly or thick hair. </li><li> Use styling products – Styling products can help you achieve the desired look and add volume or texture to your hair. </li><li> Maintain your haircut – Short haircuts require more frequent maintenance, such as trimming every 4-6 weeks. </li></ul><h2 id="faq"> FAQ </h2><h3> Does short hair make your head look bigger or smaller? </h3><p> It depends on your face shape, hair texture, and the type of short haircut you choose.
