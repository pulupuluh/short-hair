This is a normal process and is known as postpartum hair loss. It is caused by hormonal changes in the body, and it usually occurs between three and six months after giving birth.</p><p>During pregnancy, the body produces higher levels of estrogen, which causes hair to remain in the growth phase for longer. This results in fuller, thicker hair. After giving birth, estrogen levels drop, and hair enters the resting phase. This means that more hair falls out than usual, leading to postpartum hair loss.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Prevent Hair Loss After Pregnancy</h2><p>There is no guaranteed way to prevent postpartum hair loss, but there are steps you can take to reduce its severity. These include:</p><ul><li>Eating a healthy, balanced diet</li><li>Taking a multivitamin specifically designed for postpartum women</li><li>Avoiding tight hairstyles that can pull on the hair</li><li>Gently brushing and washing hair</li><li>Avoiding harsh chemicals and heat styling tools</li><li>Getting enough rest and managing stress levels</li></ul><h2 id="step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you are experiencing postpartum hair loss, there are steps you can take to manage it.

It may take several months for hair to return to its pre-pregnancy thickness and volume.</p><h3>Q: Can breastfeeding cause postpartum hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, breastfeeding can contribute to postpartum hair loss. This is because breastfeeding can cause hormonal changes in the body, which can affect hair growth.</p><h3>Q: Is postpartum hair loss preventable?</h3><p>A: While postpartum hair loss cannot be prevented, there are steps you can take to reduce its severity.
