An oval face shape is usually characterized by a rounded jawline and a wide forehead. While this face shape is considered to be attractive by many people, some might want to change it. Fortunately, there are several ways to make your face look less oval. In this article, we will discuss some of the best methods to achieve this goal.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>An oval face shape is considered to be the most versatile of all face shapes. It is also the most common face shape. However, if you feel that your face looks too elongated, there are ways to make it appear less oval. By using makeup, hairstyles, and other techniques, you can create the illusion of a different face shape.</p><h2>How to</h2><h3>1. Contouring</h3><p>Contouring is a makeup technique that involves using darker shades to create the illusion of shadows on your face. By applying a bronzer or a contour powder on the sides of your forehead and under your cheekbones, you can make your face appear less oval. This technique will create the illusion of a more angular face shape.</p><h3>2. Hairstyles</h3><p>The right hairstyle can make all the difference when it comes to face shape. If you have an oval face shape, you should consider a hairstyle that adds width to your face. A layered haircut or a side-swept fringe can help balance out your face shape. You can also try a bob or a lob haircut to create the illusion of a shorter face.</p><h3>3. Facial exercise</h3><p>Facial exercise is a natural way to tone your facial muscles and make your face appear less oval. By doing facial exercises such as cheek lifts and jawline exercises, you can create a more defined face shape. These exercises can also help reduce the appearance of a double chin.</p><h3>4. Glasses</h3><p>If you wear glasses, you should choose a frame that complements your face shape. Square or rectangular frames can help balance out an oval face shape. Avoid round or oval frames, which can make your face appear more elongated.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>1. Choose the right makeup</h3><p>Choose a contour powder or bronzer that is two shades darker than your skin tone. Apply the powder on the sides of your forehead and under your cheekbones using a brush.</p><h3>2. Style your hair</h3><p>Choose a hairstyle that adds width to your face. A layered haircut, a side-swept fringe, or a bob can help balance out an oval face shape.</p><h3>3. Do facial exercises</h3><p>Do facial exercises like cheek lifts and jawline exercises for at least 10 minutes every day.</p><h3>4. Choose the right glasses</h3><p>Choose square or rectangular frames that complement your face shape.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Avoid hairstyles that are too sleek or too long, as they can make your face appear longer.</li><li>Avoid heavy bangs, as they can make your face appear more oval.</li><li>Use a highlighter on the center of your forehead and on the bridge of your nose to create the illusion of a shorter face.</li><li>Consider getting a haircut every six to eight weeks to maintain the shape of your hairstyle.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q. Can I change my face shape?</h3><p>A. No, you cannot change your face shape. However, you can use makeup, hairstyles, and other techniques to create the illusion of a different face shape.</p><h3>Q. Can facial exercises make my face look less oval?</h3><p>A. Yes, facial exercises can help tone your facial muscles and create a more defined face shape.</p><h3>Q. Can glasses make my face look less oval?</h3><p>A. Yes, choosing the right glasses can help balance out an oval face shape.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>When it comes to hair care, it is important to choose products that are suitable for your hair type. If you have dry or damaged hair, you should use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. If you have oily hair, you should use a clarifying shampoo. It is also important to use a heat protectant before using heat styling tools.</p><p>In conclusion, making your face look less oval is possible with the right makeup, hairstyles, and facial exercises. By following these tips and techniques, you can create the illusion of a different face shape and feel more confident in your appearance.</p></article>
