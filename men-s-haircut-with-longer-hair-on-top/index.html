Whether you want a classic or modern look, this guide will help you find the perfect men’s haircut with longer hair on top that fits your style.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Men’s haircut with longer hair on top is a popular trend among men who want to keep their hair long and still look stylish. This haircut usually involves keeping the hair on top of the head longer than the rest of the hair. The sides and back of the head are usually shorter or faded, which creates a nice contrast with the longer hair on top. This haircut can be styled in different ways, from slicked back to messy, and it works well with different hair types and textures.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>Getting a men’s haircut with longer hair on top is easy if you follow these simple steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the right length</h3><p>The first step is to decide how long you want your hair on top to be. You can choose a length that works with your face shape and hair texture. If you have a round face, a longer haircut can make your face look slimmer. If you have curly hair, you may want to keep the hair shorter to avoid frizz.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on the style</h3><p>Once you’ve decided on the length, it’s time to choose the style. You can go for a classic look with a side part and a slicked-back style, or you can go for a more modern look with a messy texture and volume. Talk to your hairstylist about the different options and choose a style that suits your personality and lifestyle.</p><h3>Step 3: Maintenance</h3><p>To keep your men’s haircut with longer hair on top looking great, you need to maintain it regularly. You may need to trim the hair on the sides and back of the head every few weeks to keep the contrast with the longer hair on top. You can also use styling products to keep your hair in place and add texture and volume.</p><h2>Top Tips</h2><p>Here are some top tips to keep in mind when getting a men’s haircut with longer hair on top:</p><ul><li>Choose a haircut that suits your face shape and hair texture.</li><li>Choose a style that suits your personality and lifestyle.</li><li>Find a hairstylist who has experience with men’s haircuts with longer hair on top.</li><li>Use styling products to keep your hair in place and add texture and volume.</li><li>Maintain your haircut regularly to keep it looking great.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is a men’s haircut with longer hair on top?</h3><p>A men’s haircut with longer hair on top is a haircut that involves keeping the hair on top of the head longer than the rest of the hair.
