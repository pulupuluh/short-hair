On the other hand, if you have a longer hairstyle, you can go longer between haircuts, around 6-8 weeks.</p><p>Secondly, your hair texture also plays a significant role. If you have thick, coarse hair, you may need to get a haircut more frequently than someone with thin, fine hair. This is because thick hair tends to grow faster and loses its shape more quickly.</p><p>Lastly, your lifestyle also influences how often you should get a haircut. If you're someone who spends a lot of time outdoors or in the sun, your hair may get damaged more quickly due to exposure to UV rays and other environmental factors.
