Itâs important to start with clean, dry hair so you can accurately assess the length.</li><li><strong>Gather your hair into a ponytail:</strong> Use your comb to gather your hair into a high ponytail at the crown of your head. The placement of the ponytail will determine where the layers fall.</li><li><strong>Position the ponytail:</strong> Hold the ponytail straight up and position it where you want the shortest layer to be. Use a hair tie to secure the ponytail in place.</li><li><strong>Cut the ponytail:</strong> Use your sharp scissors to cut the ponytail straight across at the desired length.

Make sure the second ponytail includes the first layer.</li><li><strong>Cut the second ponytail:</strong> Use your scissors to cut the second ponytail straight across at the desired length. This will create the next layer of your haircut.</li><li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue this process, creating new ponytails and cutting them at the desired length until you have achieved the desired number of layers.</li><li><strong>Blend the layers:</strong> Use your scissors to blend the layers together by cutting into the ends of your hair at an angle.
