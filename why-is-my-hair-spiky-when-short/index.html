You're not alone! Many people wonder why their hair becomes spiky when it's cut short. In this article, we'll explore the reasons behind this phenomenon and provide tips on how to manage it.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>When hair is cut short, the natural weight of the hair is removed, and it becomes easier for the hair to stand up. This is because there is less gravity pulling the hair down. Additionally, short hair tends to be more porous, meaning it absorbs moisture more easily. When the hair absorbs moisture, it swells, causing the hair to stand up even more.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're wondering how to manage your spiky short hair, there are a few things you can try:</p><h3>1. Use the right products</h3><p>Using the right products can help control your hair's spiky tendencies. Look for products that provide hold and control, such as pomades or waxes. Apply a small amount to your hair and style as desired.</p><h3>2. Blow-dry your hair</h3><p>Blow-drying your hair can help tame spiky hair by directing the hair in the direction you want it to go. Use a round brush to smooth the hair down while blow-drying.</p><h3>3. Style with your fingers</h3><p>Using your fingers to style your hair can help create a more natural, textured look.
