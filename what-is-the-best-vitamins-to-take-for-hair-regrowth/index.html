Make sure to follow the recommended daily intake and consult with your doctor before taking any supplements.</p><h2 id="vitamin-b">B Vitamins</h2><p>The B vitamins, including biotin, niacin, and cobalamin (B12), are crucial for healthy hair growth.

Iron deficiency, also known as anemia, is a common cause of hair loss.</p><p>Make sure to include iron-rich foods in your diet, such as spinach, red meat, and lentils. If you have an iron deficiency, your doctor may recommend taking iron supplements.</p><h2 id="zinc">Zinc</h2><p>Zinc is important for healthy hair growth as it helps produce and repair hair tissue.
