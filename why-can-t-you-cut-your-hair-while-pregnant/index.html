First, some hair treatments, such as chemical straightening and coloring, can be harmful to you and your baby. The chemicals in these treatments can be absorbed through your skin and into your bloodstream, which could potentially harm your developing baby.</p><p>Second, pregnancy hormones can affect your hair in a variety of ways. Some women experience hair growth and thicker hair during pregnancy, while others may experience hair loss or thinning. Because of these hormonal changes, it may be best to avoid drastic changes to your hair during pregnancy, such as getting a short haircut or dramatic hair color change.</p><h3>Hair Treatments to Avoid During Pregnancy</h3><p>While there is no definitive list of hair treatments to avoid during pregnancy, here are a few that you may want to steer clear of:</p><ul><li>Hair dyes: While some studies have shown that hair dyes are safe during pregnancy, others have suggested that they may increase the risk of certain cancers in children. If you do choose to dye your hair during pregnancy, it's best to wait until after the first trimester.</li><li>Chemical straightening treatments: These treatments, which use harsh chemicals to straighten curly or wavy hair, can be particularly harmful during pregnancy. The chemicals can be absorbed through your scalp and into your bloodstream, potentially harming your baby.</li><li>Hot oil treatments: While these treatments may seem like a natural way to condition your hair, they can actually be dangerous during pregnancy.
