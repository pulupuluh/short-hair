Losing hair can be a stressful experience for both men and women.

In this article, we will discuss how to prevent bald spots on the head and the steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.</p><h2>What are Bald Spots on Head?</h2><p>Bald spots on the head are areas of hair loss that can be caused by several factors such as hereditary conditions, medical conditions, and lifestyle habits. Hair loss can occur on any part of the head, including the scalp, hairline, temples, and crown. Bald spots can be temporary or permanent, and the severity of hair loss can vary from person to person.</p><h2>How to Prevent Bald Spots on Head?</h2><p>Here are some tips to help prevent bald spots on the head:</p><h3>1.
