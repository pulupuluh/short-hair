Here are some of the best haircuts for fat round faces in 2020:</p><h3>The Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut is a short and sassy haircut that looks great on fat round faces. The key is to keep the hair on top of your head slightly longer than the sides. This will create the illusion of length and make your face appear slimmer.</p><h3>The Bob</h3><p>The bob is a classic haircut that never goes out of style. For fat round faces, we recommend a long bob that falls just below the chin. This will elongate your face and create a more flattering look.</p><h3>The Shag</h3><p>The shag is a layered haircut that looks great on fat round faces. The layers will add movement and texture to your hair, creating a more dynamic look.</p><h3>The Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>If you want to keep your hair long, consider adding side-swept bangs to your look.

Try using a texturizing spray or mousse to add some volume and movement to your hair.</p><h3>Try a Side Part</h3><p>Instead of parting your hair down the middle, try a side part. This will create a more asymmetrical look and draw attention away from the roundness of your face.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to styling your hair for a fat round face:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, towel-dried hair.</li><li>Apply a volumizing mousse to your roots.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair using a round brush, focusing on the roots.</li><li>Use a curling iron or straightener to add texture to your hair.</li><li>Finish with a texturizing spray to add volume and hold.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your hair and keeping it looking its best:</p><h3>Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Regular trims will help keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends from forming.</p><h3>Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Using a deep conditioning treatment once a week will help keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</p><h3>Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Excessive heat styling can damage your hair and make it look dry and frizzy.
