Pay attention to how much hair you see on your brush or in the shower drain. It's normal to lose up to 100 hairs a day, but if you are consistently seeing more than that, it's time to take action.</p><h3>Thinning Hair</h3><p>If you notice that your hair is getting thinner or your scalp is becoming more visible, this could be a sign of hair loss. Look for areas where your hair is noticeably thinner, and pay attention to any changes in your hairline.</p><h3>Bald Spots</h3><p>If you notice bald spots on your scalp, this is a clear sign of hair loss. Bald spots can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, stress, and certain medical conditions.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step by Step</h2><p>If you are concerned about hair loss, here are some steps you can take:</p><h3>1.
