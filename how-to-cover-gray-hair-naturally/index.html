It's been used for centuries in many cultures around the world. Henna comes in a powder form, which is mixed with water to create a paste. The paste is then applied to the hair and left on for several hours. When the paste is rinsed off, the hair will have a reddish-brown tint, which can help cover gray hair.</p><h3>Coffee</h3><p>Coffee is another natural ingredient that can help cover gray hair. It contains natural pigments that can help darken the hair. To use coffee to cover gray hair, brew a strong pot of coffee and let it cool. Then, pour the coffee over your hair and let it sit for at least an hour. Rinse your hair with cool water and repeat the process as needed.</p><h3>Black Tea</h3><p>Black tea can also be used to cover gray hair. It contains tannins, which help darken the hair. To use black tea to cover gray hair, brew a few tea bags in a pot of hot water. Let the tea cool and then pour it over your hair.
