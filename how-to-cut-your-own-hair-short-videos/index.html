Use hair ties or clips to keep each section separate.</li><li>Starting with the back sections, use clippers or scissors to trim the ends of your hair. Be sure to work slowly and carefully, checking your progress in the mirror as you go.</li><li>Next, move on to the front sections of your hair. Again, work slowly and carefully, trimming the ends to your desired length.</li><li>Use a comb to check for any uneven spots or stray hairs. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that your haircut is even all around.</li><li>Finish off by using a spray bottle filled with water to dampen your hair, then style as desired.</li></ol><p>Remember, cutting your own hair takes practice, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt doesn't turn out perfectly.
