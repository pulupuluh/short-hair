If you have this face shape, you might find it challenging to choose the right hairstyle that complements your features. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for medium length hair that can enhance your natural beauty. In this article, we will provide you with a complete guide on how to choose and style the perfect medium length hair for heart shaped face.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Medium length hair is a versatile option for heart shaped face as it can balance out the proportions of your face. This length falls between the chin and the shoulders, providing ample room for experimentation. You can choose from a range of styles like layers, bangs, waves, curls, and straight cuts to create a flattering look for your face shape.</p><h2>How to Choose</h2><p>The key to choosing the perfect medium length hair for heart shaped face is to balance out the width of your forehead and the narrowness of your chin. Here are some tips to keep in mind while choosing the right hairstyle:</p><h3>1. Consider Layers</h3><p>Layered hairstyles can soften the angles of your face and create a more balanced look. You can opt for long layers that start from your chin and cascade down to your shoulders. This will add volume and movement to your hair, making it look fuller and more luscious.</p><h3>2. Add Bangs</h3><p>Bangs can complement your heart shaped face by drawing attention to your eyes and cheekbones. You can go for side-swept bangs that cover one side of your forehead, or you can opt for blunt bangs that fall straight across your forehead. Just make sure to choose a length that flatters your face shape.</p><h3>3. Embrace Waves and Curls</h3><p>Wavy and curly hairstyles can add texture and volume to your hair, making it look fuller and more voluminous. You can use a curling iron or a diffuser to create loose waves or bouncy curls. This will create a soft and romantic look that complements your heart shaped face.</p><h3>4. Keep it Straight</h3><p>Straight hair can also work well for heart shaped face as long as you keep it sleek and polished. You can use a flat iron to straighten your hair and add shine. A center part can also help balance out the proportions of your face.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the right hairstyle for your heart shaped face, here is a step by step guide on how to style your medium length hair:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. Rinse it off with cold water to add shine and prevent frizz.</p><h3>2. Towel Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Gently towel dry your hair to remove excess water. Do not rub it vigorously as it can damage your hair.</p><h3>3. Apply Hair Serum</h3><p>Apply a hair serum or oil to your damp hair to protect it from heat damage and add shine. Spread it evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends.</p><h3>4. Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a blow dryer to dry your hair while brushing it with a round brush. This will help create volume and movement in your hair.</p><h3>5. Style Your Hair</h3><p>Use a curling iron, flat iron, or diffuser to style your hair according to your preference. You can create loose waves, bouncy curls, or straight and sleek hair.</p><h3>6. Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish your look with a light mist of hairspray to hold your hair in place and add shine.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind while styling your medium length hair for heart shaped face:</p><p>- Avoid hairstyles that add volume to the top of your head as they can make your forehead look wider.</p><p>- Choose hair accessories that complement your face shape, such as headbands, clips, or barrettes.</p><p>- Experiment with different styles and textures to find the one that suits you the best.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What hairstyles should heart shaped faces avoid?</h3><p>Heart shaped faces should avoid hairstyles that add volume to the top of their head, such as high ponytails, pigtails, or bouffant hairstyles. They should also avoid hairstyles that make their chin look narrower, such as chin-length bobs or blunt bangs.</p><h3>Can heart shaped faces pull off short hair?</h3><p>Heart shaped faces can pull off short hair as long as they choose the right style. Short hairstyles that add volume to the top of the head and create balance between the forehead and the chin can be flattering for this face shape.</p><h3>How do I choose the right hair color for my heart shaped face?</h3><p>You can choose the right hair color for your heart shaped face by considering your skin tone and eye color. Warm tones like honey, caramel, and golden blonde can complement warm skin tones, while cool tones like ash blonde, platinum, and chocolate brown can complement cool skin tones.
