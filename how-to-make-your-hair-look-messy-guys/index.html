This can be done through the use of styling products or by blow-drying your hair with a diffuser.</li><li>Layering: Another key element of the messy look is layering. This means having different lengths and textures throughout your hair, which adds to the overall messy, disheveled vibe.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what to aim for, let's get into the step-by-step instructions.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's how to make your hair look messy guys:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, towel-dried hair.

This will help to add volume and texture to your hair while minimizing frizz. Use your fingers to scrunch your hair as you dry it.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a styling tool to add some additional texture and movement.
