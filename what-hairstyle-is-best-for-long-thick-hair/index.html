While it can look stunning, it can also be difficult to manage and style. If you're looking for some inspiration for your long thick locks, read on for our top hairstyle recommendations.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Long thick hair is defined as hair that is longer than shoulder-length and has a large amount of hair strands. This hair type can be challenging to manage, but there are many hairstyles that can help tame it while still looking fabulous.</p><h2>How-To</h2><p>The best hairstyle for long thick hair is one that considers the texture and volume of your hair. Here are some of the most popular hairstyles for long thick hair:</p><h3>1. Layered Haircut</h3><p>A layered haircut can help thin out your hair and add movement and texture.

This hairstyle is effortless and creates a relaxed, carefree look. To achieve this look, use a curling iron or wand to create loose waves in your hair. Finish with a texturizing spray for added volume and hold.</p><h3>3. Half-Up Half-Down</h3><p>The half-up half-down hairstyle is perfect for long thick hair as it allows you to show off your length while keeping your hair out of your face. To achieve this look, take the top half of your hair and pull it back, securing it with a hair tie or clip. Leave the bottom half of your hair down for a sleek and polished look.</p><h2>Step-by-Step</h2><p>Here are some step-by-step instructions for achieving the perfect hairstyle for long thick hair:</p><h3>1.
