It serves a variety of purposes, including protecting the delicate skin in the pubic area, providing cushion during sexual activity, and trapping bacteria and other debris that can cause infections. During menopause, women experience a decrease in their estrogen levels, which can lead to changes in their pubic hair.</p><p>Some women may experience thinning of their pubic hair during menopause, while others may experience a complete loss of pubic hair. However, the good news is that pubic hair can grow back after menopause.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>If you are concerned about the loss of your pubic hair during menopause, there are several things you can do to encourage hair growth:</p><h3>1.
