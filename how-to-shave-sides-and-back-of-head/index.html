Shaving the sides and back of your head is a popular and easy option that can be done at home. However, if you're new to shaving your own hair, it can be intimidating. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps of how to shave sides and back of head in a relaxed and easy-to-understand language.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Shave Sides and Back of Head</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Shaving Sides and Back of Head</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care After Shaving Sides and Back of Head</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Shave Sides and Back of Head</h2><p>Shaving the sides and back of your head requires some preparation and the right tools. Here's what you'll need:</p><ul><li>A quality hair clipper or trimmer with adjustable guard sizes</li><li>A handheld mirror or a wall-mounted mirror that allows you to see the back of your head</li><li>A comb or brush to help guide the clippers</li><li>A towel or cape to protect your clothes from hair clippings</li><li>A clean razor or electric shaver to clean up the hairline and any missed spots</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Follow these steps to shave the sides and back of your head:</p><h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Before you begin, it's essential to wash and dry your hair. Wet hair can clog the clippers, and dry hair is easier to cut. Comb your hair in the direction that it naturally falls to remove any tangles or knots.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Guard Size</h3><p>Start with a higher guard size and work your way down gradually. This will ensure that you don't cut too much hair off at once. It's better to take off less hair than to cut too much and regret it later.</p><h3>Step 3: Start with the Sides</h3><p>Begin at the temples and work your way downwards, following the natural curve of your head. Use the comb or brush to guide the clippers and keep the hair even. Work your way around your head, making sure to keep the guard level and the clippers flush against your scalp.</p><h3>Step 4: Move to the Back</h3><p>Next, move to the back of your head. Use the same technique as the sides, starting from the nape of your neck and moving upwards. It's important to use the mirror to check for any missed spots.</p><h3>Step 5: Clean up the Hairline</h3><p>Use a razor or electric shaver to clean up your hairline and any missed spots. Be careful not to cut too close to the scalp, as this can cause irritation and razor burn.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Shaving Sides and Back of Head</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to make shaving the sides and back of your head easier:</p><ul><li>Start with a higher guard size and work your way down gradually</li><li>Use a handheld mirror and a wall-mounted mirror to see the back of your head</li><li>Use a comb or brush to guide the clippers and keep the hair even</li><li>Be careful not to cut too close to the scalp, as this can cause irritation and razor burn</li><li>Use a clean razor or electric shaver to clean up the hairline and any missed spots</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can I shave my head with a razor?</h3><p>Yes, you can shave your head with a razor, but it's recommended that you use a clipper or trimmer with guard sizes to ensure an even cut.</p><h3>How often should I shave my head?</h3><p>It depends on your preferences and hair growth rate. Some people shave their heads every few days, while others do it once a week or even less frequently.</p><h3>How do I prevent razor burn when shaving my head?</h3><p>To prevent razor burn, make sure to use a sharp razor, shave with the grain of your hair, and use a shave gel or cream to lubricate your skin.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care After Shaving Sides and Back of Head</h2><p>After shaving the sides and back of your head, it's essential to take care of your hair and scalp.
