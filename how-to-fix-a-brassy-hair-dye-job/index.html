Don't worry, you're not alone. Many people experience this issue after dyeing their hair, especially if they have naturally dark hair or have used a cheap dye product. The good news is that fixing a brassy hair dye job is not as difficult as it may seem. In this article, we will discuss some tips and tricks on how to fix a brassy hair dye job at home.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Brassy hair is a common issue that occurs when hair turns yellow or orange after dyeing. This can happen due to various reasons such as using a low-quality dye, leaving the dye on for too long, or using the wrong developer. Brassiness can make your hair look dull and lifeless, and it can be frustrating for anyone who has spent time and money on dyeing their hair.</p><h2>How to Fix a Brassy Hair Dye Job</h2><p>If you want to fix a brassy hair dye job, there are a few things you can do at home. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Use a Purple Shampoo</h3><p>Purple shampoo is the most popular solution for fixing brassy hair. This shampoo contains purple pigments that neutralize the yellow and orange tones in your hair. Use it once or twice a week, and you will notice a significant difference in the tone of your hair.</p><h3>2. Tone Your Hair</h3><p>If purple shampoo doesn't work, you can try toning your hair with a toner or hair dye that has blue or violet undertones. This will help neutralize the brassy tones and give your hair a more natural look.</p><h3>3. Use a Hair Mask</h3><p>A hair mask can help hydrate and nourish your hair, which can help reduce brassiness. Look for a hair mask that contains ingredients such as argan oil, coconut oil, or shea butter.</p><h3>4. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair and make brassiness worse. If you want to fix your brassy hair, avoid using heat styling tools such as flat irons or curling irons. Instead, let your hair air dry or use a heat protectant spray.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to fix a brassy hair dye job:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup. Rinse your hair thoroughly and towel dry.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Purple Shampoo</h3><p>Apply purple shampoo to your hair and massage it into your scalp. Leave it on for 5-10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.</p><h3>Step 3: Tone Your Hair</h3><p>If the purple shampoo didn't work, you can try toning your hair with a toner or hair dye that has blue or violet undertones. Follow the instructions on the product and rinse thoroughly.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a Hair Mask</h3><p>Apply a hair mask to your hair and leave it on for 10-15 minutes.

You need a purple shampoo that contains purple pigments.</p><h3>Q: How often should I use purple shampoo?</h3><p>A: Use purple shampoo once or twice a week, depending on how brassy your hair is.</p><h3>Q: Can I use a hair mask instead of toner?</h3><p>A: Yes, a hair mask can help reduce brassiness, but toners are more effective.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After fixing your brassy hair, it's important to take care of it properly.
