For loose waves, wrap small sections of hair around the barrel of a curling iron and hold for a few seconds before releasing. For tighter curls, use a smaller barrel curling iron and hold for a longer period of time.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish your look with a light hairspray to hold your style in place.
