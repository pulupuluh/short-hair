From the bouffant to the beehive, the women of the 60s knew how to make a statement with their hair. If you have short hair and want to channel the glamour of the 60s, this guide is for you. We’ll take you through some of the most popular 1960 hairstyles for short hair, and give you tips on how to achieve the look.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 1960s was a decade of change and experimentation. Women were breaking free from the constraints of the previous decade and embracing new styles and attitudes. The hairstyles of the 60s were no exception. Short hair became popular, with women opting for pixie cuts, bobs, and other short styles. The 60s also saw the rise of the bouffant and the beehive – two iconic hairstyles that are still popular today.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>To achieve a 1960s hairstyle for short hair, you’ll need some basic styling tools and products. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li>A comb</li><li>Hairspray</li><li>Bobby pins</li><li>A teasing brush</li></ul><p>Now, let’s get started:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and letting it air dry, or blow dry it using a round brush to add volume. You can also use a volumizing mousse or spray to give your hair some extra lift.</p><h3>Step 2: Tease your hair</h3><p>Using a teasing brush, tease your hair at the crown to create volume. Take small sections of hair and backcomb them towards the roots. Be careful not to over-tease, as this can damage your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Style your hair</h3><p>There are many 1960s hairstyles for short hair to choose from. Here are a few options:</p><h3>Short and Sleek</h3><p>If you have a pixie cut or a short bob, you can create a sleek and sophisticated look by using a flat iron to straighten your hair. Apply hairspray to keep your hair in place.</p><h3>The Bouffant</h3><p>The bouffant is a classic 1960s hairstyle that’s perfect for short hair. To achieve this look, tease your hair at the crown and smooth the top layer with a comb. Pull your hair back into a low ponytail, leaving some volume at the crown. Twist the ponytail and pin it into a loose bun, leaving some hair out at the sides. Finish with hairspray.</p><h3>The Beehive</h3><p>The beehive is another iconic 1960s hairstyle that can be adapted for short hair. To create a mini beehive, tease your hair at the crown and smooth the top layer. Pull your hair back into a high ponytail and tease the ponytail. Twist the ponytail and pin it into a beehive shape, leaving some hair out at the sides. Finish with hairspray.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect 1960s hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use hairspray to keep your hair in place.</li><li>Be gentle when teasing your hair, as over-teasing can damage your hair.</li><li>Experiment with different styles to find the one that works best for you.</li><li>Accessorize with a headband or scarf to complete the look.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What products should I use for a 1960s hairstyle?</h3><p>Use a comb, hairspray, bobby pins, and a teasing brush to achieve a 1960s hairstyle for short hair. You can also use a volumizing mousse or spray to give your hair some extra lift.</p><h3>Can I achieve a 1960s hairstyle with short hair?</h3><p>Yes, there are many 1960s hairstyles for short hair to choose from. Pixie cuts, bobs, and other short styles can be styled in a variety of ways to achieve a 1960s look.</p><h3>What is the difference between a bouffant and a beehive?</h3><p>A bouffant is a hairstyle that’s characterized by volume at the crown and sleek, smooth hair at the sides. A beehive is a hairstyle that’s characterized by a high, rounded shape at the crown and hair that’s pulled back and twisted into a bun or updo.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your hair healthy and looking its best, be sure to wash and condition it regularly. Use a heat protectant spray when using hot styling tools, and avoid over-teasing your hair. If you’re concerned about damage, consider using a deep conditioning treatment once a week.</p><p>With these tips and techniques, you can achieve a 1960s hairstyle for short hair that’s both timeless and beautiful.
