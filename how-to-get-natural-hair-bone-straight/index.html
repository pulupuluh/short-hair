In this article, we'll show you how to get natural hair bone straight using gentle techniques and minimal products.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Get Natural Hair Bone Straight</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Maintaining Bone-Straight Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Straightened Hair</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Get Natural Hair Bone Straight</h2><p>Getting bone-straight hair without chemicals or heat can seem like a daunting task, but it's possible with the right techniques and products. Here are a few ways to achieve the look:</p><h3>Blow-Drying with a Round Brush</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to get natural hair bone straight is to blow-dry it with a round brush. Start by washing your hair and applying a heat protectant spray. Then, divide your hair into sections and use a round brush to blow-dry each section while pulling it taut with the brush. This will help straighten the hair and eliminate frizz.</p><h3>Using a Straightening Brush</h3><p>A straightening brush is a great tool for achieving bone-straight hair without heat damage. Simply brush your hair with the straightening brush while applying gentle tension to each section. This will help smooth out the hair and create a sleek, straight look.</p><h3>Roller-Setting</h3><p>Roller-setting is another gentle way to straighten natural hair. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Then, divide it into sections and roll each section with a large, foam roller. Let the rollers set for several hours or overnight, then remove them and gently comb out your hair. You should be left with smooth, straight hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Ready to get started? Here's a step-by-step guide to getting natural hair bone straight:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. This will help remove any buildup and prepare your hair for straightening.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Heat Protectant Spray</h3><p>Before using any heat tools, it's important to protect your hair from damage. Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair, focusing on the ends and any areas that are particularly prone to damage.</p><h3>Step 3: Divide Your Hair into Sections</h3><p>Divide your hair into manageable sections using clips or hair ties. This will make it easier to straighten each section individually.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a Round Brush and Blow Dryer</h3><p>If you're using a round brush and blow dryer, start at the roots and work your way down each section. Use the brush to pull each section taut as you blow-dry it, which will help straighten the hair and eliminate frizz.</p><h3>Step 5: Use a Straightening Brush</h3><p>If you're using a straightening brush, simply brush each section while applying gentle tension. The brush will help smooth out the hair and create a sleek, straight look.</p><h3>Step 6: Roller-Set Your Hair</h3><p>If you're roller-setting your hair, divide each section into smaller sections and roll them with a large, foam roller. Let the rollers set for several hours or overnight, then remove them and gently comb out your hair.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Bone-Straight Hair</h2><p>Now that you've achieved bone-straight hair, it's important to maintain it.
