You are not alone! Balding affects millions of people worldwide, and it can be a frustrating and confidence-destroying experience. But don’t worry, there are a variety of ways to fix balding on top of your head. In this article, we will explore how to fix balding on top of head, step-by-step, with tips and hair care advice to help you regain your hair confidence.</p><h2>How to Fix Balding on Top of Head</h2><p>Firstly, it's important to understand the cause of the balding. Balding on top of the head is usually caused by genetics, age, stress, and hormonal changes. Once you know the root cause, you can take steps to fix balding on top of your head. Here are some methods:</p><h3>Hair Transplant Surgery</h3><p>Hair transplant surgery is an effective way to fix balding on top of the head. It involves the transplantation of hair follicles from the back and sides of the scalp to the balding areas. The procedure is done under local anesthesia, and the recovery period is usually a few days to a week. Hair transplant surgery has come a long way in recent years, and the results are natural-looking and long-lasting.</p><h3>Topical Treatments</h3><p>Topical treatments such as minoxidil and finasteride can help fix balding on top of the head. Minoxidil is a topical solution that is applied directly to the scalp. It works by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles, stimulating hair growth. Finasteride is a medication that is taken orally. It works by blocking the hormone that causes hair loss. Topical treatments are effective, but they require consistent use to maintain the results.</p><h3>Diet and Lifestyle Changes</h3><p>Diet and lifestyle changes can also help fix balding on top of the head. A healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals can promote hair growth. Eating foods such as eggs, nuts, and leafy greens can help. Exercise and stress reduction techniques such as yoga and meditation can also help improve hair growth.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Fix Balding on Top of Head</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to fix balding on top of the head:</p><h3>Step 1: Consult with a Doctor</h3><p>Consult with a doctor to determine the cause of the balding.
