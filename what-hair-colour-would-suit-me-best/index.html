Choosing a new hair colour can be a daunting task, especially if you're not sure what would suit you best. In this article, we'll be discussing how to determine what hair colour would suit you best and provide tips on hair care to maintain your new look.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Before we dive into what hair colour would suit you best, let's first understand the different types of hair colours available. There are three main categories of hair colours: natural, unnatural and fantasy. Natural hair colours include shades of blonde, brown, black, and red. Unnatural colours include shades of blue, green, pink, and purple. Fantasy colours include any colour outside of the natural and unnatural categories, such as silver or rainbow colours.</p><h2>How To Determine What Hair Colour Would Suit You Best</h2><p>There are several factors to consider when choosing a hair colour that would suit you best. These factors include your skin tone, eye colour, natural hair colour and your personal style. </p><h3>Skin Tone</h3><p>Your skin tone is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a hair colour. People with cool skin tones, which have pink or blue undertones, look best with cool hair colours such as ash blonde, platinum blonde, cool brown, and black. People with warm skin tones, which have yellow or golden undertones, look best with warm hair colours such as honey blonde, caramel brown, and auburn.</p><h3>Eye Colour</h3><p>Your eye colour can also help determine what hair colour would suit you best. For example, people with blue or green eyes look best with cool hair colours, while people with brown or hazel eyes look best with warm hair colours.</p><h3>Natural Hair Colour</h3><p>Your natural hair colour can also play a role in determining what hair colour would suit you best. If you have dark hair, it may be best to stick with darker shades or warm colours. If you have light hair, you may want to consider cool colours or lighter shades.</p><h3>Personal Style</h3><p>Your personal style can also influence what hair colour would suit you best. If you have a bold and adventurous style, you may want to consider fantasy colours such as purple or blue. If you have a more classic style, you may want to consider natural hair colours.</p><h2>Step By Step Guide To Choosing The Right Hair Colour</h2><p>Now that you have a better understanding of what factors to consider when choosing a hair colour, here are some steps to help you choose the right hair colour:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Skin Tone</h3><p>Take a look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you have cool skin undertones. If they appear green, you have warm skin undertones.</p><h3>Step 2: Consider Your Eye Colour</h3><p>Think about your eye colour and whether it's warm or cool. This can help guide you towards a hair colour that will complement your eyes.</p><h3>Step 3: Look At Your Natural Hair Colour</h3><p>Consider your natural hair colour and whether it's warm or cool. This can help guide you towards a hair colour that will suit you best.</p><h3>Step 4: Determine Your Personal Style</h3><p>Think about your personal style and whether you want a bold or classic look.</p><h2>Tips For Maintaining Your New Hair Colour</h2><p>Once you've chosen your new hair colour, it's important to take care of it to maintain your new look. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use A Colour-Safe Shampoo</h3><p>Using a colour-safe shampoo can help prolong the life of your new hair colour.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair and cause your new colour to fade faster. Try to avoid using heat styling tools or use them sparingly.</p><h3>Tip 3: Protect Your Hair From The Sun</h3><p>The sun can cause your hair colour to fade faster. If you're going to be out in the sun for an extended period, wear a hat or use a hair product with SPF.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What hair colour would suit me best if I have a neutral skin tone?</h3><p>If you have a neutral skin tone, you can pretty much pull off any hair colour. Consider your eye colour and personal style to help guide you towards a hair colour that will suit you best.</p><h3>Can I dye my hair if I have naturally curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can dye your hair if you have naturally curly hair. Just make sure to use a colour-safe shampoo and conditioner to help maintain your new colour.</p><h3>What hair colour would suit me best if I have dark brown eyes?</h3><p>If you have dark brown eyes, warm hair colours such as honey blonde, caramel brown, and auburn will suit you best.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>It's important to take care of your hair to maintain your new hair colour. Here are some hair care tips:</p><h3>Tip 1: Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help prevent split ends and keep your hair looking healthy.</p><h3>Tip 2: Use A Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>A deep conditioning treatment can help keep your hair moisturized and prevent breakage.</p><h3>Tip 3: Eat A Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet can help promote healthy hair growth and prevent hair loss.</p><p>In conclusion, choosing a new hair colour can be a fun and exciting experience. By considering your skin tone, eye colour, natural hair colour, and personal style, you can determine what hair colour would suit you best. Remember to take care of your hair to maintain your new look and enjoy your new hair colour!</p></article>
