But with the right products, you can achieve a curly look that's both stylish and easy to maintain. The key is to choose products that are specifically designed for men's hair, and that work well with your hair type and texture. </p><h2 id="how-to"> How to </h2><p> To make straight hair curly, you'll need to use a combination of styling products and techniques.

Look for a cream that's specifically designed for men's hair, and that contains ingredients like beeswax or shea butter to help define your curls and prevent frizz. </p><h3> Curl-Defining Gel </h3><p> In addition to cream, you can also use a curl-defining gel to help set your curls and add some shine.
