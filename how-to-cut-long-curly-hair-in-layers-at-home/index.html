Use a wide-tooth comb to create a clean part.</li><li>Section your hair into four parts: two in the front and two in the back. Clip up the sections you are not working on.</li><li>Starting from the back, take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it straight across.
