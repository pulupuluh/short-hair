This hairstyle can be customized in many ways, with different lengths and styles for the top and sides. Some men choose to slick back the long hair on top, while others prefer a messy, textured look. This hairstyle is versatile, and it can be worn in many different settings, from casual to formal.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Achieve the Long on Top Short on the Sides Men's Hairstyle</h2><p>The long on top short on the sides men's hairstyle is relatively easy to achieve, and it doesn't require much maintenance. Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Lengths</h3><p>The first step in achieving this hairstyle is to choose the right lengths for the top and sides of your head. The top should be long enough to style, but not so long that it becomes unmanageable. The sides and back should be short, but not so short that they look like a buzz cut. A good length for the sides is usually around a 2 or 3 on the clippers.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Hair</h3><p>The next step is to cut the hair to the chosen lengths. You can either do this yourself or go to a professional barber. If you're doing it yourself, make sure you have the right tools, including clippers, scissors, and a comb. Use the clippers to cut the sides and back to the desired length, and use the scissors to trim the hair on top to the right length.</p><h3>Step 3: Style the Hair</h3><p>Once the hair is cut to the right lengths, it's time to style it. The exact styling will depend on your personal preference and the length of your hair on top. Some men prefer a slicked-back look, while others prefer a messy, textured style. Use a styling product, such as pomade or wax, to achieve the desired look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to achieve the long on top short on the sides men's hairstyle:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Lengths</h3><p>Decide how long you want the hair on top to be, and choose a length for the sides and back.
