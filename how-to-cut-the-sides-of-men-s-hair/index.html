You don't want to end up with a choppy or uneven haircut.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut the Sides of Men's Hair</h2><p>When it comes to cutting the sides of men's hair, there are a few different techniques you can use. Some people prefer to use clippers, while others prefer to use scissors. Here's a general overview of how to cut the sides of men's hair:</p><h3>1. Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure the hair is clean and dry. Wet hair can be more difficult to cut and style, so it's best to work with dry hair.</p><h3>2. Comb the Hair</h3><p>Use a comb to part the hair on the sides. You can choose how far up the hair you want to cut, but a good rule of thumb is to cut up to the point where the hair starts to curve.</p><h3>3. Choose Your Technique</h3><p>Next, choose your cutting technique. You can use clippers or scissors, depending on your preference. Clippers are faster and easier to use, but scissors give you more control over the cut.</p><h3>4. Start Cutting</h3><p>Start cutting the hair, using either the clippers or scissors. Work in small sections, cutting the hair at an angle to create a gradual, tapered look. Make sure to cut evenly on both sides.</p><h3>5. Blend the Hair</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting both sides, use the clippers or scissors to blend the hair at the back and the top. This will create a smooth, even look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed, step-by-step guide to cutting the sides of men's hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>Start by washing the hair with shampoo and conditioner.
