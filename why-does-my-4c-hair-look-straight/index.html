It's often characterized by its tiny curls and coils, which can be difficult to manage. However, some people with 4c hair have noticed that their hair looks straight. This can be confusing and frustrating, especially if you're trying to embrace your natural curls. In this post, we'll discuss why your 4c hair may look straight and what you can do about it.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>4c hair can look straight for a variety of reasons.

Relaxers and straightening treatments can alter your hair's natural texture, making it appear straight even if it's naturally curly.</p><p>Finally, your hair may look straight if you've been wearing protective styles like braids or weaves for an extended period of time. These styles can put tension on your hair, causing it to stretch and lose its natural curl pattern.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>If you're wondering how to get your 4c hair to look curly again, there are a few things you can try. The first step is to stop using heat styling tools and chemical treatments.

These products can help define your curls and enhance your hair's natural texture.</p><p>If you've been wearing protective styles, give your hair a break and wear your hair out for a few weeks.
