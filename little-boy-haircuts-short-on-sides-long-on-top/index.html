This style features short hair on the sides and back of the head, while the hair on top is left longer and styled in various ways. The length and style of the hair on top can vary depending on the individual's preference, but the general idea is to keep the hair longer on top and shorter on the sides.</p><h2>How to Achieve the Look</h2><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>The first step in achieving the "short on sides, long on top" haircut is to determine the length you want for your little boy's hair. The length of the hair on top should be at least 2-3 inches long, while the sides and back should be buzzed or faded.</p><h3>Step 2: Divide the Hair</h3><p>Divide the hair into sections using hair clips or combs. Start from the top and work your way down to the sides and back.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use a clipper to cut the sides and back of the head. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one to achieve a fade or a buzz cut. Make sure to blend the hair smoothly from the top to the sides.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top</h3><p>Use scissors to cut the hair on top. Start from the front and work your way back. Use a comb to lift the hair and cut it to the desired length. You can also use thinning shears to create texture and volume.</p><h3>Step 5: Style the Hair</h3><p>Use a styling product such as gel, pomade, or wax to style the hair on top. You can comb it to the side, slick it back, or create a messy, textured look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when getting a "short on sides, long on top" haircut:</p><ul><li>Choose a hairstyle that suits your little boy's face shape and hair type.</li><li>Bring a picture of the haircut you want to show to the stylist.</li><li>Visit a reputable and experienced hairstylist to ensure a quality haircut.</li><li>Maintain the haircut by getting regular trims every 4-6 weeks.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best hair type for a "short on sides, long on top" haircut?</h3><p>The "short on sides, long on top" haircut works best on thick, straight or wavy hair. If your little boy has thin or curly hair, this hairstyle may not be the best choice.</p><h3>How do I maintain the haircut?</h3><p>To maintain the haircut, you should get regular trims every 4-6 weeks. You can also use styling products to keep the hair on top in place and maintain the shape of the haircut.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your little boy's hair healthy and shiny, you should follow a regular hair care routine.
